<li><strong>When I try to run rdiff-backup it says "ImportError: No

happening?</strong>

<P>rdiff-backup versions 0.2.x require Python version 2.1 or later,
and versions 0.3.x require Python version 2.2 or later.  If you don't
know what version of python you are running, type in "python -V" from
the shell.  I'm sorry if this is inconvenient, but rdiff-backup uses
generators, iterators, nested scoping, and static/class methods
extensively, and these were only added in version 2.2.

<P>If you have two versions of python installed, and running "python"
defaults to an early version, you'll probably have to change the first
line of the rdiff-backup script.  For instance, you could set it to:

<pre>
#/usr/bin/env python2.2
</pre>
</li>

<P>There is no formal specification, but here is a rough description
(settings are always cumulative, so 5 displays everything 4 does):

<li><strong>Does rdiff-backup run under Windows?</strong>

<P>Yes, apparently it is possible.  First, follow Jason Piterak's
instructions:

Subject: Cygwin rdiff-backup

Hello all,
  On a lark, I thought I would attempt to get rdiff-backup to work under
Windows98 under Cygwin. We have a number of NT/Win2K servers in the field
that I'd love to be backing up via rdiff-backup, and this was the start of
getting that working. 

SUMMARY: 
  o You can get all the pieces for rdiff-backup working under Cygwin.
  o The backup process works up to the point of writing any files with
timestamps.
      ... This is because the ':' character is reserved for Alternate Data
Stream (ADS) file designations under NTFS.

HOW TO GET IT WORKING (to a point, anyway):
  o Install Cygwin
  o Download the Python 2.2 update through the Cygwin installer and install.
  o Download the librsync libraries from the usual place, but before
compiling...
  o Cygwin does not use/provide glibc. Because of this, you have to repoint
some header files in the Makefile:

   -- Make sure that you have /usr/include/inttypes.h
      redirected to /usr/include/sys/types.h. Do this by:

      create a file /usr/include/inttypes.h with the contents:
      #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
  o Put rdiff-backup in your PATH, as you normally would.

</pre>

Then, whenever you use rdiff-backup (or at least if you are backing up
to or restoring from a Windows system), use the <strong>--windows-time-format</strong>
switch, which will tell rdiff-backup not to put a colon (":") in a
filename (this option was added after Jason posted his message).
