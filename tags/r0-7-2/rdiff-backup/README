Thank you for trying rdiff-backup.

Remember that you must have Python 2.2 or later and librsync installed
(this means that "python" and "rdiff" should be in your path).  To
download, see http://www.python.org and
http://sourceforge.net/projects/rproxy/ respectively.

For remote operation, rdiff-backup should be in installed and in the
PATH on remote system(s) (see man page for more information).


If you have the above installed, and it still doesn't work, contact
Ben Escoto <bescoto@stanford.edu>, or post to the mailing list (see
web page at http://www.stanford.edu/~bescoto/rdiff-backup for more
information).
