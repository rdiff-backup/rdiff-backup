<a name="backup"><h3>Backing up</h3></a>
<ul>

<li><p>Simplest case---backup local directory <code>foo</code> to local
directory <code>bar</code>.  <code>bar</code> will end up a copy of
<code>foo</code>, except it will contain the directory
foo/rdiff-backup-data, which will allow rdiff-backup to restore
previous states.

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup foo bar</code></blockquote></p> </li>

<li> <p>Simple remote case---backup directory <code>/some/local-dir</code>
to the directory <code>/whatever/remote-dir</code> on the machine
hostname.net.  It uses ssh to open the necessary pipe to the remote
copy of rdiff-backup.  Just like the above except one directory is on
a remove computer.

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup /some/local-dir hostname.net::/whatever/remote-dir</code></blockquote></p> </li>

<li> <p>This time the source directory is remote and the destination
is local.  Also, we have specified the username on the remote host (by
default ssh will attempt to log you in with the same username you have
on the local host).

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup user@hostname.net::/remote-dir local-dir</code></blockquote> </p> </li>

<li> <p>It is even possible for both the source and destination
directories to be on other machines.  Below we have also added the
<code>-v5</code> switch for greater verbosity (verbosity settings go
from 0 to 9, with 3 as the default), and the
<code>--print-statistics</code> switch so some statistics will be
displayed at the end (even without this switch, the statistics will
still be saved in the <code>rdiff-backup-data</code> directory).

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup -v5 --print-statistics user1@host1::/source-dir user2@host2::/dest-dir</code></blockquote> </p> </li>
</ul>


<a name="restore"><h3>Restoring</h3></a>
<ul>

<li><p>Suppose earlier we have run <code>rdiff-backup foo bar</code>,
with both foo and bar local.  We accidentally deleted
<code>foo/dir</code> and now want to restore it from <code>bar/dir</code>.

<blockquote><code>cp -a bar/dir foo/dir</code></blockquote>

That's right, since rdiff-backup makes a mirror, we can retrieve files
using standard commands like <code>cp</code>.</p>
</li>

<li><p>For the rest of the examples in the section, we will assume
that the user has backed up with the command <code>rdiff-backup
local-dir host.net::/remote-dir</code>.  Of course, in all these
examples it would be equally possible to have the source being remote
and the backup directory local.</p>

<p>In this case we can't use <code>cp</code> to copying
<code>host.net::remote-dir/file</code> to <code>local-dir/file</code>
because they are on different machines.  We can get rdiff-backup to
restore the current version of that file using either of these::

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup --restore-as-of now
host.net::/remote-dir/file local-dir/file<br/>rdiff-backup -r now
host.net::/remote-dir/file local-dir/file</code></blockquote>

The <code>--restore-as-of</code> (or <code>-r</code> for short) switch
tells rdiff-backup to restore instead of back up, and the
<code>now</code> option indicates the current time.</p>
</li>

<li><p>But the main advantage of rdiff-backup is that it keeps version
history.  This command restores
<code>host.net::/remote-dir/file</code> as it was 10 days ago into a
new location <code>/tmp/file</code>.

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup -r 10D host.net::/remote-dir/file /tmp/file</code></blockquote>

Other acceptable time strings include <code>5m4s</code> (5 minutes and
4 seconds) and <code>2002-03-05</code> (March 5th, 2002).  For more
information, see the TIME FORMATS section of the manual page.</p> </li>

<li> <p>Finally, we can use rdiff-backup to restore directory from an
increment file.  Increment files are stored in
<code>host.net::/remote-dir/rdiff-backup-data/increments</code> and
hold the previous versions of changed files.  If you specify one
directly:

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup
host.net::/remote-dir/rdiff-backup-data/increments/file.2003-03-05T12:21:41-07:00.diff.gz local-dir/file</code></blockquote>

rdiff-backup will tell from the filename that it is an rdiff-backup
increment file and thus enter restore mode.  Above the restored version is written to <code>local-dir/file</code>.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="delete_older"><h3>Deleting older files</h3></a>

<p>Although rdiff-backup tries to save space by only storing file
differences, eventually space may run out in the destination
directory.  rdiff-backup's <code>--remove-older-than</code> mode can
be used to delete older increments.</p>

<p>This section assumes that rdiff-backup has been used in the past to
back up to <code>host.net::/remote-dir</code>, but all commands would
work locally too, if the hostname were ommitted.</p>

<ul> <li> <p> This commands deletes all information concerning file
versions which have not been current for 2 weeks:

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup --remove-older-than 2W host.net::/remote-dir</code></blockquote>

Note that an existing file which hasn't changed for a year will still
be preserved.  But a file which was deleted 15 days ago cannot be
restored after this command is run.</p></li>

<li> <p> As when restoring, there are a variety of ways to specify the
time.  The <code>20B</code> below tells rdiff-backup to only preserve
information from the last 20 rdiff-backup sessions.  (<code>nnB</code>
syntax is only available in versions after 0.13.1.)

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup --remove-older-than 20B host.net::/remote-dir</code></blockquote></p></li>
</ul>


<a name="exclude"><h3>File selection with include/exclude options</h3></a>

<p>Sometimes you don't want to back up all files.  The various
<code>--include</code> and <code>--exclude</code> options can be used
to select exactly which files to back up.  See the man page for a list
of all the options and their definitions.</p>

<ul><li><p>In this example we exclude <code>/mnt/backup</code> to
avoid an infinite loop.

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup --exclude /mnt/backup /
/mnt/backup</code></blockquote>

(Actually rdiff-backup can automatically detect simple loops like the
one above.)  This is just an example, in reality it would be important
to exclude <code>/proc</code> as well.</p></li>

<li><p>This example is more realistic.  We have excluded
<code>/proc</code>, <code>/tmp</code>, and <code>/mnt</code>.
<code>/proc</code> in particular should never be backed up.  Also, the
source directory happens to be remote.

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup --exclude /tmp --exclude /mnt
--exclude /proc user@host.net::/ /backup/host.net</code></blockquote></p></li>

<li><p>Multiple include and exclude options take precedence in the
order they are given.  The following command would back up
<code>/usr/local/bin</code> but not <code>/usr/bin</code>.

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup --include /usr/local --exclude /usr / host.net::/backup</code></blockquote></p></li>

<li><p>rdiff-backup uses rsync-like wildcards, where <code>**</code>
matches any path and <code>*</code> matches any path without a
<code>/</code> in it.  Thus this command:

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup --include /usr/local --include /var --exclude '**' / /backup</code></blockquote>

backs up only the <code>/usr/local</code> and <code>/var</code>
directories.  The single quotes <code>''</code> are not part of
rdiff-backup and are only used because many shells will expand
<code>**</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Here is a more complicated example:

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup --include '**txt' --exclude /usr/local/games --include /usr/local --exclude /usr --exclude /backup --exclude /proc / /backup</code></blockquote>

The above command will back up any file ending in <code>txt</code>,
even <code>/usr/local/games/pong/scores.txt</code> because that
include has highest precedence.  The contents of the directory
<code>/usr/local/bin</code> will get backed up, but not
<code>/usr/share</code> or <code>/usr/local/games/pong</code>.</p></li>

<li>rdiff-backup can also accept a list of files to be backed up.  If
the file <code>include-list</code> contains these two lines:

<blockquote><pre>
/var
/usr/bin/gzip
</pre></blockquote>

Then this command:

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup --include-filelist include-list --exclude '**' / /backup</code></blockquote>

would only back up the files <code>/var</code>, <code>/usr</code>,
<code>/usr/bin</code>, and <code>/usr/bin/gzip</code>, but not
<code>/var/log</code> or <code>/usr/bin/gunzip</code>.  Note that this
differs from the <code>--include</code> option, since <code>--include
/var</code> would also match <code>/var/log</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>The same file list can both include and exclude files.  If we
create a file called <code>include-list</code> that contains these
lines:

<blockquote><pre>**txt
- /usr/local/games
/usr/local
- /usr
- /backup
- /proc</pre></blockquote>

Then the following command will do exactly the same thing as the
complicated example two above.

<blockquote><pre>rdiff-backup --include-globbing-filelist include-list / /backup</pre></blockquote>

Above we have used <code>--include-globbing-filelist</code> instead of
<code>--include-filelist</code> so that the lines would be interpreted
as if they were specified on the command line.  Otherwise, for
instance, <code>**txt</code> would be considered the name of a file,
not a globbing string.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="query"><h3>Getting information about the backup directory</h3></a>

The following examples assume that you have run <code>rdiff-backup
in-dir out-dir</code> in the past.

<ul><li><p>This command finds all new or old files which contain the
string <code>frobniz</code>.

<blockquote><code>find out-dir -name '*frobniz*'</code></blockquote>

rdiff-backup doesn't obscure the names of files at all, so often using
traditional tools work well.</p></li>

<li><p>Either of these equivalent commands lists the times of the
available versions of the file <code>out-dir/file</code>.  It may be
useful if you need to restore an older version of
<code>in-dir/file</code> but aren't sure which one.

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup --list-increments
out-dir/file<br/>rdiff-backup -l
out-dir/file</code></blockquote></p></li>

<li><p>The following command lists all the files under
<code>out-dir/subdir</code> which has changed in the last 5 days.

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup --list-changed-since 5D out-dir/subdir</code></blockquote></p></li>

<li><p>This command lists all the files that were present in
<code>out-dir/subdir</code> 5 days ago.  This includes files that have
not changed recently as well as those that have been deleted in the
last 5 days.

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup --list-at-time 5D
out-dir/subdir</code></blockquote></p></li>

<li>rdiff-backup writes one statistics file per session to the
<code>out-dir/rdiff-backup-data</code> directory.  An average of the
files can be displayed using the <code>--calculate-average</code>
option and specifying the statistics files to use.

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup --calculate-average out-dir/rdiff-backup-data/session_statistics*</code></blockquote></p></li>
</ul>


<a name="misc"><h3>Miscellaneous other commands</h3></a>

<ul> <li><p> If you are having problems connecting to a remote host, the
<code>--test-server</code> command may be useful.  This command simply
verifies that there is a working rdiff-backup server on the remote
side.

<blockquote><code>rdiff-backup --test-server hostname.net::/ignored</code></blockquote> </p></li>

</ul>
