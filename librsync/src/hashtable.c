/* Open addressing works best if it can take advantage of memory caches using
   locality for probes of adjacent buckets on collisions. So we pack the keys
   tightly together in their own key table and avoid referencing the element
   table and elements as much as possible. Key value zero is reserved as a
   marker for an empty bucket to avoid checking for NULL in the element table.
   If we do get a hash value of zero, we -1 to wrap it around to 0xffff. */
