"""
This library allows to create a set of files (and directories), using a
structure of dictionaries.

The name of the files and directories in the base directory are used as keys
in a dictionary of dictionaries.

A directory has the type "dir" or a "subs" key to contain sub-directories or
files.

Both directories and files can have the following keys:
* a "mode" to define the chmod to apply

Files can also have the following keys:
* "content" which is written to the file.
* "open" flag, "t" or "b" for the write mode to the file

Example:
{
    "a_dir": {"subs": {"fileA": {"content": "initial"}, "fileB": {}}},
    "empty_dir": {"type": "dir", "mode": 0o777},
    "a_bin_file": {"content": b"some_binary_content", "open": "b"},
}
