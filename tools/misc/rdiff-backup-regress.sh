sessions i.e. to the state it was in before the last n backup sessions.

$THIS can be used to remove an unwanted recent backup run \
- for instance one that excludes a lot of the usual data or includes a lot \
of extraneous data. Because rdiff-backup saves a full history of data via \
incremental diff (delta) files, \
excluding or including a lot of data on one occasion and then correcting \
it the next time will bloat your repository/archive substantially (by twice \
the compressed size of the relevant data). By using $THIS to regress the \
archive back to the point before the incorrect backup, you can undo this \
and recover the lost space. You can consider it a workaround for a \
missing --regress option in rdiff-backup.

If the session (aka run or increment) you want to remove is not the most \
recent then you can use the -n option to remove the requisite number of \
sessions from the most recent up to the one you want to \
remove - it is not possible to remove just one session from the middle \
of an archive. If you want to remove some of the earliest, rather than the \
most recent, sessions you \
should instead use rdiff-backup with --remove-older-than option.

$THIS can also be used with a corrupted archive if regression \
does not happen automatically and cannot be initiated with \
--check-destination-dir; however this may not \
be successful, and could make things worse, so you are advised \
to take a backup of the entire repository first.

$THIS works by 'tricking' rdiff-backup into thinking that the last backup is \
faulty (by creating a second current_mirror file), and then \
runs rdiff-backup --check-destination-dir to perform the regression. With -n \
option it just repeats this operation a number of times. \
The methodology was originally suggested by Janne Peltonen - kudos.

Note that regressions can take a long time; don't take any other actions \
on the archive until $THIS has completed.

Health Warnings: $THIS removes one or more recent backups sessions from your \
rdiff-backup archive. Once removed, a backup session is irrecoverable. \
Earlier sessions in the same archive should still be recoverable.

If $THIS is run with superuser permissions (e.g. sudo), and the original \
archives were created by a different user then after recovery some file \
ownerships may have changed. You are advised if possible to run $THIS as the \
same user who originally created and updated the rdiff-backup archive that is \
being regressed.

Usage:\t$THIS [options] archive-path
Note that, unlike rdiff-backup, $THIS must be run on the machine hosting the \
repository, or (untested) via NFS mount.

Example:
    ./$THIS -n 2 /home/fred/backup

Options:\t-f - Force, proceed with no prompt
\t\t-h - Show this help text and then quit
\t\t-l - Show changelog and then quit
\t\t-n num - Regress the backup recursively num times (where num is an integer) - default 1
\t\t-q - Quiet, no output unless an error occurs

Dependencies: awk bash coreutils rdiff-backup sed
