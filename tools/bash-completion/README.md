# Bash completion for rdiff-backup

Install [bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion), available in most distros' repositories, and copy `rdiff-backup` to `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/`. Be sure to keep same file name to allow bash-completion to dynamic load it on demand.

This file was originally taken from [Debian rdiff-backup packaging repository](https://salsa.debian.org/python-team/applications/rdiff-backup/blob/6f71f7603b2756066e28eedeeb426334734948f9/debian/local/bash-completion).
