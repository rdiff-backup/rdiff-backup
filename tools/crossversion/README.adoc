= Vagrant setup for testing older versions of rdiff-backup
:sectnums:
:toc:

Just call `vagrant up` to get the version.

If you want to get a different version of rdiff-backup than the default one in `host_vars`, use following command:

----
ansible-playbook playbook-provision.yml -e rdiff_backup_old_version=2.0.3
----

To come back to the default version, just leave out the `-e xxx` option (or simply call `vagrant provision`).

You may call the smoke tests using the following command and validate that nothing wrong happens:

----
ansible-playbook -v playbook-smoke-test.yml
----

You can use the current development version by using something like the following, after having built from source using `./setup.py build`:

----
PATH=../../build/scripts-3.8:$PATH PYTHONPATH=../../build/lib.linux-x86_64-3.8 \
	ansible-playbook -v playbook-smoke-test.yml
----

*CAUTION:* the version shown locally might be DEV or any other version 	installed elsewhere locally, but the version used is definitely the 	built development version.
