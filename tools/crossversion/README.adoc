= Vagrant setup for testing older versions of rdiff-backup
:sectnums:
:toc:

Just call `vagrant up` to get the version.

If you want to get a different version of rdiff-backup than the default one in `host_vars`, use following command:

----
ansible-playbook playbook-provision.yml -e rdiff_backup_old_version=2.0.3
----

To come back to the default version, just leave out the `-e xxx` option (or simply call `vagrant provision`).

You may call the smoke tests using the following command and validate that nothing wrong happens:

----
ansible-playbook -v playbook-smoke-test.yml
----

You can use the current development version by creating and activating a virtualenv and installing the current code into it with `pip install .`.
Use `pip install .[meta]` (the dot is still there) to install also optional dependencies to manage metadata (ACL, EA...).
