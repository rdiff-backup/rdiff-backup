    <h1>rdiff-backup file format</h1>

This web page describes how rdiff-backup stores backup information, at
least as of version 0.6.x.  This a pretty boring document and should
only be useful to people who want to write utilities to automatically
process or create rdiff-backup compatible files.  Normal people can
use rdiff-backup easily without reading any of this (I hope).

<h3>1. Overview</h3>

<P> When rdiff-backup is run, it copies the source directory (and all
the source files, i.e. files in the source directory) to the mirror
directory, and writes to a special data directory.  For instance, when
"rdiff-backup foo bar" is run, <i>foo</i> is the source directory,
<i>bar</i> is the mirror directory, and <i>bar/rdiff-backup-data</i> is the
data directory.

<P>Each source file is associated with a mirror file, and possibly one
or more increments files.  If the source file is named
<i>path/to/some_file</i> relative to the source directory, then its
associated mirror file is also <i>path/to/some_file</i>, but relative
to the mirror directory.  The associated increments are all named
<i>increments/path/to/some_file.EXT</i> relative to the data
directory, with the exception of the increments associated with the
source directory itself, which are just named <i>increments.EXT</i>.
The extensions will be described later.

<P>The purpose of all this is to provide transparent incremental
backup.  Each mirror file is an exact duplicate of its source file
counterpart (one exception: the mirror directory contains the data
directory; the source directory doesn't), while each increment file
represents the state of its corresponding source file counterpart at
some time in the past.

<h3>2. The mirror directory</h3>

<P>After rdiff-backup is run, the contents of the mirror directory are
the same as the contents of the source directory.  This is why it is
called the mirror directory.  But there is one exception - the mirror
directory will contain the data directory while the source directory
won't.  (If the source directory contains a directory called
<i>rdiff-backup-data</i>, it will be ignored.)

<P>What constitutes sameness here could vary between instances.  For
example, a non-root user running rdiff-backup will not be able to
change the permissions on the mirror files, so in this case two files
could be the same even if they have different ownership.  But, the
closer the better.

<h3>3. The data directory</h3>

<P>rdiff-backup may write to log files in this directory, like
<i>backup.log</i> and <i>restore.log</i>.  rdiff-backup never reads
these, so they can be deleted if convenient.

<P>More importantly, all the increment files are stored in the data
directory.

<h4>3a. Increment file names</h4>

<P>As mentioned earlier, each increment file is associated with a
source file.  The source directory itself is associated with the
increment files <i>increments.EXT</i>; source files of the form
<i>path/to/some_file</i> are associated with increment files
<i>increments/path/to/some_file.EXT</i>.

<P>The extension has the form [timestring].[suffix].  The timestring
is in w3 datetime format, described at <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime">http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime</a>.
This format was chosen because it seemed semi-standard, it is not too
hard for humans to read, represented time order and ascii sort order
are the same (so 'ls' gives you the increments in order), and it
doesn't contain characters which usually require quoting when typed
into a shell.  An example of a w3 datetime timestring is
<i>2001-12-05T18:18:57-07:00</i>, meaning December 5th, 2001,
6:18:15PM, US Pacific time (7 hours before UTC).  The increment file
represents the state of the source file at the indicated time.

<P>The suffix is one of <i>snapshot</i>, <i>diff</i>, <i>dir</i>, or
<i>missing</i>, indicating an increment file of type snapshot, diff,
or, dir and missing markers, respectively.

<h4>3b. Increment file types</h4>

There are four increment file types:

<ul>

<li><strong>snapshot - </strong>A snapshot increment file is an exact
copy of its associated source file, including applicable permissions,
ownership, etc.  Snapshots are never made of directories.

<li><strong>diff - </strong>A diff snapshot has the same metafile
information (permissions, etc.) as its source counterpart, but instead
of containing all the data of the source file at some time, it
contains a diff, as produced by <strong>rdiff</strong> from the next
later version of the source file to the version covered by the diff
increment.  Clearly, diff increments will only be created for regular
files.

<li><strong>dir markers - </strong>Dir markers just indicate that the
associated source file is a directory.  A dir marker has the same
permissions, ownership, etc. as its source file.  Dir markers are only
created by an instance of rdiff-backup if something about a directory
changes (this includes the content of files in the directory, the
permissions of the directory, the permissions of a file in a
subdirectory of the directory, and so forth).

<li><strong>missing markers - </strong>Missing markers indicate that
the associated source file does not exist at the given time and are
made whenever a file exists at one backup instance that didn't exist
at the last one.

</ul>

<h3>4. Basic restoration procedure</h3>

The above more or less determines the basic restore strategy.  Suppose
we want to restore a file back to time <strong>T</strong>.  First we
make the mirror file the restoration candidate.  If there are no
increments, then we are done - the mirror file is what we want.  If
there are increments, consider the one dated last.  If it is a:

<ul>
<li><strong>snapshot</strong>, then that increment becomes the
restoration candidate;

<li><strong>diff</strong>, then apply that diff to the restoration
candidate, and copy the permissions, etc., from the diff to get the
new restoration candidate;

<li><strong>dir marker</strong>, then the restoration candidate is a
directory with the given permissions, etc.  Also, start a recursive
process and restore all the files in that directory too;

<li><strong>missing marker</strong>, then there is no more restoration
candidate - the file may not have existed at that time.
</ul>

Then repeat this procedure, moving backward in time, applying earlier
and earlier diffs.  The final restoration candidate is the source file
as it was at time <strong>T</strong>.

<h3>5. Concluding remarks</h3>

Well, that's all.  I realize that the above falls short of
mathematical rigor, but hopefully it is enough for the readers'
purposes.  Please mail me or post to the mailing list if something is
unclear or too brief.
