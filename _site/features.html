<div id="main">
<p>For many people hard disks provide the form of persistent storage
that is most readily available and cheapest per MB. I think that
rdiff-backup is often the best way to back one hard drive to
another.</p>
<div class="feature-list"><ul>
<li><p><strong>Easy to use:</strong> In most cases, the command
<pre>
     rdiff-backup dir1 dir2
</pre>will work out-of-the-box to backup dir1 to dir2.
<pre>
     rdiff-backup dir1 user@system::/dir2
</pre> will backup dir1 to dir2 on a different system (provided rdiff-backup is installed on both systems). rdiff-backup
also comes with a lot of <a href="docs.html">up-to-date documentation</a>.</p>
<li><p><strong>Creates mirror:</strong> rdiff-backup makes the backup
directory into an almost exact copy of the source directory (the only
difference is one extra subdirectory on the backup side). If you
delete a file from the source directory you can simply copy it from
the backup directory, use "find" or "locate" to find the file, or use
any other familiar utility. Also, if the two directories are on
different disks, you can recover almost immediately if the disk
containing the source directory crashes, just by mounting the backup
directory where the source directory used to be.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keeps increments:</strong> Normally, with a mirror, any
changes made to the source directory are immediately sent to the
backup directory, and old changes are lost. rdiff-backup saves those
changes in the form of reverse diffs, so you can recover the older
form of the file.</p>
<P>For instance, suppose last week you deleted half of some document,
thinking that what you had written was garbage. Yesterday, your
backup event ran, saving these changes. Today you realize that you
were on to something and want what you deleted back. If you just
mirrored, you would be out of luck, since the copy on your mirror
would be the newer one. With rdiff-backup, the newer version would
indeed be present, but in a special directory (rdiff-backup-data/)
there would be a file that recorded this change. Running rdiff-backup
on this file recovers the version from a week ago.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Preserves all information:</strong> Whether you restore
from the mirror directory or from an earlier incremental backup,
rdiff-backup will reproduce your files exactly as they were. Files
missing at the time of backup will also be missing after the restore.
Files hard linked when backed up will be hard linked after the
restore. rdiff-backup also preserves permissions, user and group
ownership, modification time, device files, fifos, and symlinks.</p>
<P>Sometimes it is impossible for the information to be replicated
exactly on the destination. For instance, ownership cannot usually be
replicated without root access at the destination; windows file
systems may not be case sensitive and have no ownership at all.
rdiff-backup records file metadata in a separate file so that all
information is preserved even if the destination file system is
missing features.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Space efficient:</strong> Suppose you have a large
database file that changes a little bit every day. A normal
incremental backup would keep saving copy after copy of this database,
wasting a lot of space. rdiff-backup uses librsync, which implements
the same efficient diffing algorithm that rsync uses. It works on
binary files as well as text, so only a fraction of the data in your
database would be saved in each incremental backup.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bandwidth efficient:</strong> rdiff-backup depends on
librsync, and thus uses the same diffing algorithm as rsync (rsync and
rdiff-backup strictly speaking do not share any code however). As a
result, when when writing to a remote location, rdiff-backup will only
send diffs over and can use much less bandwidth than, say, ftp or
scp.</p>
<P>For instance, suppose you slightly alter large file A to make large
file A', and A is still on the remote system. When rdiff-backup is
run, it will only send over the diff A->A' (in order to "copy" A' to
the remote system). Neither A nor A' needs to be sent in its
entirety.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transparent data format:</strong> Except for recording
the hard link structure of old data sets, rdiff-backup doesn't
absolutely require any data files formatted specifically for rdiff-backup.
So if you want to stop using rdiff-backup in the future, you won't be
stuck with any undecipherable files in some strange format. As noted
above, the mirror directory will just be a copy of the source
directory as it was when rdiff-backup was last run. Earlier states of
your files are saved just by 1) keeping a copy of them, 2) in diff
form as produced by rdiff, or 3) as a gzipped version of 1 or
2.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Filesystem feature autodetection:</strong> People use
rdiff-backup in many different environments. The filesystem they want
to back up may be on Linux, Windows, or Mac. It may or may not be
case sensitive, support characters like ":", have resource forks,
extended attributes, or access control lists. Moreover, the file
system they are backing up to may or may not support these features.</p>
<p>rdiff-backup tries to handle these situations automatically without
the need for switches like --acl --ea --no-ownership, etc. When run
it will run tests on both the source and destination filesystems to
see what features each supports like case sensitivity, changing
uid/gid ownership, resource forks, extended attributes, or access
control lists. To see the results of this testing, run rdiff-backup
with verbosity 4 or higher, as in <code>-v4</code>.</p>
<li><p><strong>Mac OS X resource fork support:</strong> On Mac OS X
systems, rdiff-backup will backup the resource forks which store, for
instance, Finder information. Most unix backup programs would only
backup the data forks and discard the resource forks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ACL and EA support:</strong> If rdiff-backup can find
the <a href="http://pylibacl.sourceforge.net/">pylibacl</a> and <a
href="http://pyxattr.sourceforge.net/">pyxattr</a>
(<a href="http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/xattr">mac version</a>) modules, and if the file system supports these features, rdiff-backup will preserve Access
Control Lists and user-level Extended Attributes. ACLs are not supported,
however, on Mac OS X or Windows as those systems do not use standard
POSIX.1e access controls.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keeps statistics:</strong> After each session
rdiff-backup writes summary statistics to a text file. You can
inspect these to see how large your repository is, how fast it is
growing, and how much space rdiff-backup is saving you, and more.
Here is an example <code>session_statistics</code> file:<p>
<p><pre>StartTime 1124018521.00 (Sun Aug 14 06:22:01 2005)

</pre></p>
<p>rdiff-backup also saves very detailed statistics in a
<code>file_statistics</code>. This file is also in (compressed) text
form, but is usually too voluminous to read manually.</p> </li>
