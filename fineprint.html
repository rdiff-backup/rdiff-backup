The command

<pre>rdiff-backup / host.net::/target-dir</pre>

will backup your root filesystem and all the subdirectories to
host.net, making /target-dir a mirror of /, and storing increments in
/target-dir/rdiff-backup-data.  Assuming, of course, that:

<P>
<ol>
<li>rdiff-backup and ssh are properly installed on both computers, and
in the PATH.  host.net must be running an ssh server.  (rdiff-backup
can use something other than ssh; see the <a
href="rdiff-backup.1.html">man page</a> for more information.)
</li>

<li>all source files are readable, and all necessary destination files
are writable.  In the example above this requires running as root.
You could run only one side as root, as in:

<pre>rdiff-backup / user@host.net::/target-dir</pre>

but then rdiff-backup wouldn't make the dev files.  Also, all the
files in /target-dir would be owned by user, because only root can
chown.  However, uid/gid information would be preserved in a separate
file.
</li>
</ol>

<p>In reality, other options would probably be added, for instance to
exclude /proc and tmp directories, change permissions if necessary,
etc.  Here is how I used to run it nightly on my system:

<p>/usr/bin/rdiff-backup --exclude /usr/local/games --exclude /tmp/'*' --exclude /var/tmp/'*' --exclude /mnt --exclude /proc --exclude /sys / /mnt/back
