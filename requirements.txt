# CAUTION: do not edit, this file is generated by calling:

# This file describes the (development) dependencies so that we can be warned
# by GitHub dependency graph if something is compromised, see:
# https://docs.github.com/en/github/visualizing-repository-data-with-graphs/about-the-dependency-graph

# We don't pin versions unless we see a reason for it. Having developers with
# slightly different versions of the dependencies increases our chance to
# detect non working combinations.

# You can also use the file to install your environment with the following
# command:
#	pip install -r requirements.txt

#--- mandatory ---

# we need specific versions to properly support pyproject.toml and git archives
