CVS README - Notes for people checking out of CVS
-------------------------------------------------

Getting rdiff-backup to run:
----------------------------

If you want to run a version of rdiff-backup checked out of CVS into
your $RDB_CVS directory, change to $RDB_CVS/rdiff_backup and run the
./compilec.py file:

    cd $RDB_CVS/rdiff_backup; python compilec.py

With any luck, _librsync.so and C.so libraries will appear in that
directory.  Then run rdiff-backup, making sure that all the files are
in your PYTHONPATH:

    PYTHONPATH=$RDB_CVS $RDB_CVS/rdiff-backup <arguments>


Running the unit tests:
-----------------------

If you want to try some of tests, you first have to get the
testfiles.tar.gz tarball.  It is available at

http://rdiff-backup.stanford.edu/testfiles.tar.gz

To untar it, root is required because the tarball contains device
files, files with various uid/gid, etc.  If you don't have root, it's
ok, all the tests except for roottest.py may still work.

So, three steps:

1) Make sure the the C modules are compiled as explained above:

    cd $RDB_CVS/rdiff_backup; python compilec.py

2) Untar the testfiles tarball, as root if you have it:

    cd $RDB_CVS/testing; tar -xvzf testfiles.tar.gz

3) In the testing directory, run each of the *test.py files as
   desired.  For instance,

    cd $RDB_CVS/testing; python rpathtest.py

   If python restoretest.py doesn't work, try running
   ./makerestoretest3
