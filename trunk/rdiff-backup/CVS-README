CVS README - Notes for people checking out of CVS
-------------------------------------------------

Getting rdiff-backup to run:
----------------------------

If you want to run a version of rdiff-backup checked out of CVS into
your $RDB_ROOT directory, change to $RDB_ROOT/rdiff_backup and run the
./compilec.py file.  With any luck, _librsync.so and C.so libraries
will appear in that directory.  Then run rdiff-backup, making sure
that all the files are in your PYTHONPATH:

PYTHONPATH=$RDB_ROOT $RDB_ROOT/rdiff-backup


Running the unit tests:
-----------------------

If you want to try some of tests, you first have to untar the
testfiles.tar.gz as root (the tarball contains device files, files
with various uid/gid, etc):

cd testing; tar -xvzf testfiles.tar.gz

Then run the various *test.py files, for instance:

cd testing; python lazytest.py
