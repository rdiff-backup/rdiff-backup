Security audit

--read-only and --write-only /usr/foo switches to tighten security up some.


Think about adding Gaudet's idea for keeping track of renamed files.



Don't produce stack trace which looks like crash/include file name in
logging stats

Add to above Dean Gaudet's suggestion: make errors look prettier (like tar).

Examine and fix recovery problems.

If don't recover hardlink support and hardlink support on, don't resume.

Fix Finish bug so error finishing in subdirectory won't mess up
finishing parent directory.
