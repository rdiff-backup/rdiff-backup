---------[ Short term (next version) ]-------------------------

Fix --print-statistics


---------[ Medium term ]---------------------------------------

Look at Kent Borg's suggestion for restore options and digests.

Add --list-files-changed-between or similar option, to list files that
have changed between two times

Add ACL support

Add --dry-run option (target for v1.1.x)

Add # of increments option to --remove-older-than

Make argument shortcut for cstream

Make --calculate-averages work with directory_statistics file.

Write configuration file, to make sure settings like --quoting-char,
--windows-time-format, etc., don't change between sessions,
backup/restoring, etc.

---------[ Long term ]---------------------------------------

Think about adding Gaudet's idea for keeping track of renamed files.

Look into different inode generation techniques (see treescan, Dean
Gaudet's other post).
