Figure out why files getting unnecessarily incremented when upgrading
from 0.12.x.

Consider adding --datadir option (Jean-Sébastien GOETSCHY)

See if regressing takes too much memory (large directories).

write test case for --calculate-statistics

Use ctime to check whether files have been changed.  See message:

by Andrew Bressen.

Profile 0.13.x

Examine regress handling of acls/eas/resource forks.

Look into that strange regress error July 22nd on
prog/old/rdiff-backup/testing/testfiles/long...

---------[ Medium term ]---------------------------------------

Look into sparse file support (requested by Stelios K. Kyriacou)

Look into security.py code, do some sort of security audit.

Look at Kent Borg's suggestion for restore options and digests.

Add --list-files-changed-between or similar option, to list files that
have changed between two times

Add --dry-run option (target for v1.1.x)

Add # of increments option to --remove-older-than

---------[ Long term ]---------------------------------------

Think about adding Gaudet's idea for keeping track of renamed files.

Look into different inode generation techniques (see treescan, Dean
Gaudet's other post).
