# tox (https://tox.readthedocs.io/) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file will run the
# test suite on all supported python versions. To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.

# Configuration file for tests as root.
# Call with `sudo tox -c tox_root.ini`
# Use tox_slow.ini for longer running tests and tox.ini for normal tests.
