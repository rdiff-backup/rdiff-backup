== [#ToC2]#Duplicity#

Duplicity is a backup program that is similar to rdiff-backup in some
ways. It grew out of rdiff-backup, is also written in Python, and uses
librsync for bandwidth efficiency. However, rdiff-backup's archives are
meant to be as easy to view as possible, while duplicity's are as hard
to view as possible---they can be encrypted with GnuPG. Also, duplicity
saves data in the more conventional full+forward delta format instead of
rdiff-backup's mirror+reverse deltas. Finally, rdiff-backup another copy
of rdiff-backup on the remote destination, while duplicity can access
remote locations with scp or ftp (other backends may be supported
later).
