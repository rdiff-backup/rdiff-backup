The command

....
rdiff-backup / host.net::/target-dir
....

will backup your root filesystem and all the subdirectories to host.net,
making /target-dir a mirror of /, and storing increments in
/target-dir/rdiff-backup-data. Assuming, of course, that:

. rdiff-backup and ssh are properly installed on both computers, and in
the PATH. host.net must be running an ssh server. (rdiff-backup can use
something other than ssh; see the link:rdiff-backup.1.html[man page] for
more information.)
. all source files are readable, and all necessary destination files are
writable. In the example above this requires running as root. You could
run only one side as root, as in:
+
....
rdiff-backup / user@host.net::/target-dir
....
+
but then rdiff-backup wouldn't make the dev files. Also, all the files
in /target-dir would be owned by user, because only root can chown.
However, uid/gid information would be preserved in a separate file.

In reality, other options would probably be added, for instance to
exclude /proc and tmp directories, change permissions if necessary, etc.
Here is how I used to run it nightly on my system:

/usr/bin/rdiff-backup --exclude /usr/local/games --exclude /tmp/'*'
--exclude /var/tmp/'*' --exclude /mnt --exclude /proc --exclude /sys /
/mnt/back
