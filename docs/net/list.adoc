Update 9/25/2002:::
  The rdiff-backup mailing list was formerly hosted by
  keywest.stanford.edu. The keywest administrator recently obtained his
  degree and left for a real job. His absence was noted a couple weeks
  later (9/20)... Anyway, it's unclear if/when keywest will be back up,
  so I applied for and received a Savannah account. Thank you very much,
  Savannah, for your support.

  I am not automatically resubscribing keywest.stanford.edu mailing list
  members because it may break their filtering and because they did not
  consent to receive mail from the new list. *So former subscribers,
  please
  http://mail.freesoftware.fsf.org/mailman/listinfo/rdiff-backup-users[subscribe]
  again if you still want to receive rdiff-backup traffic.* Sorry for
  the inconvenience, and I hope the new situation is more stable.
