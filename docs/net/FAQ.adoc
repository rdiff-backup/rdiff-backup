. *[#compatible]#Is rdiff-backup backwards compatible?#*
+
In general, rdiff-backup does not strive to make newer clients
compatible with older servers (or vice versa). However, there is no
intention to purposefully make different versions incompatible across
the network -- changes are introduced primarily to fix bugs or introduce
new features that cannot be implemented without breaking the network
protocol. Furthermore, rdiff-backup does try to make it possible to read
older archives.
+
When running as a client, rdiff-backup checks the version of
rdiff-backup running on the server, and prints a warning message if the
two versions are different. If you have any problems with your backup,
it is strongly recommended that you upgrade the older version before
reporting any issues.
. *[#windows]#Does rdiff-backup run under Windows?#*
+
Yes, although it is not a heavily tested configuration. Rdiff-backup can
be run as a native Windows application or under Cygwin. To run as a
native Windows application, simply download the provided .exe binary. To
setup remote operation, you will also need an SSH client, such as
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/[Putty] or
http://www.ssh.com[SSH Secure Shell]. See the documentation for more
details on
https://github.com/rdiff-backup/rdiff-backup/blob/master/docs/Windows-README.md[remote
operation under native Windows]. Dave Kempe has also made some older
.exe versions http://solutionsfirst.com.au/~dave/backup/[available for
download].
+
If you wish to run rdiff-backup under Cygwin, use at least version
1.1.12. The setup under Cygwin is the same as under other Unix-like
operating systems. From the Cygwin installer you will need Python 2.2 or
higher (under Interpreters), autoconf, automake, binutils, gcc, make,
and patchutils (all under Devel). Then you will need to compile and
install librsync, which can be downloaded
https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=56125[from
Sourceforge]. Finally, you can compile and install rdiff-backup using
the usual instructions.
+
Although some Windows filesystems lack features like FIFOs, case
sensitive filenames, or files with colons (":") in them, all of these
situations should be autodetected and compensated for by rdiff-backup.
+
If you would like more detailed instructions for compiling and
installing rdiff-backup on Cygwin, you can read this blog entry:
http://katastrophos.net/andre/blog/?p=19. Note: The patch that the blog
suggests that you download is no longer necessary starting with version
1.1.8 of rdiff-backup.
. *[#OSX]#Does rdiff-backup run under Mac OS X?#*
+
Yes, quite a few people seem to be using rdiff-backup under Mac OS X.
rdiff-backup can also backup resource forks and other Mac OS X metadata
to a traditional unix filesystem, which is can be a handy feature for
Mac users. When rdiff-backup is used to do the restore, all of the
metadata is recovered from rdiff-backup's storage.
+
The easiest option is probably to use Fink http://fink.sourceforge.net/,
which can install rdiff-backup automatically for you. With Fink, you
should install the `librsync`, `librsync-shlibs`, `python25`,
`python25-shlibs`, `xattr-py25`, and `rdiff-backup` packages. Another
option is DarwinPorts http://www.macports.org/, for which you should
install the `py-xattr` and `rdiff-backup` packages.
+
If you want to build rdiff-backup yourself, you should be able to build
librsync and rdiff-backup using the standard Unix instructions. You can
also see this message from Gerd Knops:

[parts of original message deleted]
these instructions build it fine with all tests running OK
(librsync-0.9.5.1 on OS X 10.2.1):

    aclocal
    autoconf
    automake --foreign --add-missing
    env CFLAGS=-no-cpp-precomp ./configure
    make
    make install
....
+
An important note if you use the Apple-provided version of Python:
Apple's version of Python will install rdiff-backup in something like
`/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/rdiff-backup`
and `rdiff-backup` will not be in your `$PATH`. You can copy
rdiff-backup out of this folder and into someplace reasonable like
`/usr/bin` or another directory in your `$PATH` to use it. For a full
explanation of why this happens see this post to the mailing list:
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/rdiff-backup-users/2007-06/msg00107.html.
. *[#cifs]#Can I backup files to a CIFS or smbfs mount?#*
+
You can certainly try! Using a CIFS or smbfs mount as the mirror
directory has been troublesome for some users because of the wide
variety of Samba configurations. If possible, the best solution is
always to use rdiff-backup over SSH in the default configuration. Using
rdiff-backup in the default configuration is also guaranteed to be
faster because there is lower network utilization. Rdiff-backup uses the
rsync algorithm to minimize the amount of bandwidth consumed. By using
smbfs or CIFS, the complete file is transferred over the network.
+
Under both Linux and Mac OS X, smbfs seems to be working quite well.
However, it has a 2 GB file limit and is deprecated on Linux. CIFS users
sometimes experience one of these common errors:
* rdiff-backup fails to run, printing an exception about
"`assert not upper_a.lstat()`" failing. This can be resolved by
unmounting the share, running the following command as root: +
`$ echo 0 > /proc/fs/cifs/LookupCacheEnabled` +
and then remounting the CIFS share. +
 +
* If filenames in the mirror directory have some characters transformed
to a '?' instead of remaining the expected Unicode character, you will
need to adjust the `iocharset=` mount option. This happens because the
server is using a codepage with only partial Unicode support and is not
translating characters correctly. See the mount.cifs man page for more
information. Using smbfs can also improve this situation since it has
both an `iocharset=` and a `codepage=` option.
* If you have trouble with filenames containing a colon ':', or another
reserved Windows character, try using the `mapchars` option to the CIFS
mount. At least one user has reported success when using this option
while mounting a NAS system via CIFS. See the mount.cifs man page for
more information. +
 +
* Other CIFS mount options which may be helpful include `nocase`,
`directio`, and `sfu`. Also, try changing the value of
`/proc/fs/cifs/LinuxExtensionsEnabled` (requires remount). A user with a
DroboShare reported that `-o mapchars,nocase,directio` worked for that
NAS appliance.
+
If you're still having trouble backing up to a CIFS or smbfs mount, try
searching the
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/rdiff-backup-users/[mailing-list
archives] and then sending further questions to the list.
. *[#sshfs]#Can I backup files to a sshfs mount?#*
+
Yes, however you will likely need to specify the
"`-o workaround=rename`" option to sshfs, which is available in sshfs
1.3 and newer. On MacOSX, this sshfs option is enabled by default. For
more information on this option, see the
http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/SshfsFaq[sshfs FAQ]. Also, if
you get the exception "`assert not upper_a.lstat()`" and your
destination file system is case-insensitive, try adding the
"`-o noauto_cache`" option to sshfs.
. *[#case_insensitive]#Help! Why do all my filenames now look like
;077y;070ile ?!#*
+
When backing up from a case-sensitive filesystem to a case-insensitive
filesystem (such as Mac's HFS+ or Windows's FAT32 or NTFS), rdiff-backup
escapes uppercase characters in filenames to make sure that no files are
accidentally overwritten. When a filesystem is case-preserving but
case-insensitive, it means that it remembers that a file is named "Foo"
but doesn't distinguish between "Foo", "foo", "foO", "fOo", etc.
However, filesystems such as Linux's ext3 do treat these names as
separate files.
+
Imagine you have a Linux directory with two files, "bar" and "BAR", and
you copy them to a Mac system. You will wind up with only one file (!)
since HFS+ doesn't distinguish between the names, and the second file
copied will overwrite the first. Therefore, when rdiff-backup copies
files from case-sensitive to case-insensitive filesystems, it escapes
the uppercase characters (eg, "M" is replaced with ";077", and "F" with
";070") so that no filename conflicts occur. Upon restore (from the Mac
backup server to the Linux system), the filenames are unquoted and you
will get "MyFile" back.
. *[#remove_dir]#My backup set contains some files that I just realized
I don't want/need backed up. How do I remove them from the backup volume
to save space?#*
+
The only official way to remove files from an rdiff-backup repository is
by letting them expire using the --remove-older-than option. Deleting
increments from the rdiff-backup-data directory will prevent you from
recovering those files, but shouldn't prevent the rest of the repository
from being restored.
. *[#solaris]#Does rdiff-backup work under Solaris?#*
+
There may be a problem with rdiff-backup and Solaris' libthread. Adding
"ulimit -n unlimited" may fix the problem though. Here is a post by
Kevin Spicer on the subject:
+
....
Subject: RE: Crash report....still not^H^H^H working
From: "Spicer, Kevin" <kevin.spicer@bmrb.co.uk>
Date: Sat, 11 May 2002 23:36:42 +0100
To: rdiff-backup@keywest.Stanford.EDU

Quick mail to follow up on this..
My rdiff backup (on Solaris 2.6 if you remember) has now worked
reliably for nearly two weeks after I added...

    ulimit -n unlimited

to the start of my cron job and created a wrapper script on the remote
machine which looked like this...

    ulimit -n unlimited
    rdiff-backup --server
    exit

And changed the remote schema on the command line of rdiff-backup to
call the wrapper script rather than rdiff-backup itself on the remote
machine.  As for the /dev/zero thing I've done a bit of Googleing and
it seems that /dev/zero is used internally by libthread on Solaris
(which doesn't really explain why its opening more than 64 files - but
at least I think I've now got round it).
....
. *[#speed]#How fast is rdiff-backup? Can it be run on large data
sets?#*
+
rdiff-backup can be limited by the CPU, disk IO, or available bandwidth,
and the length of a session can be affected by the amount of data, how
much the data changed, and how many files are present. That said, in the
typical case the number/size of changed files is relatively small
compared to that of unchanged files, and rdiff-backup is often either
CPU or bandwidth bound, and takes time proportional to the total number
of files. Initial mirrorings will usually be bandwidth or disk bound,
and will take much longer than subsequent updates.
+
To give one arbitrary data point, when I back up my personal HD locally
(about 36GB, 530000 files, maybe 500 MB turnover, Athlon 2000, 7200 IDE
disks, version 0.12.2) rdiff-backup takes about 15 minutes and is
usually CPU bound.
. *[#statistics]#What do the various fields mean in the session
statistics and directory statistics files?#*
+
Let's examine an example session statistics file:
+
....
StartTime 1028200920.44 (Thu Aug  1 04:22:00 2002)
EndTime 1028203082.77 (Thu Aug  1 04:58:02 2002)
ElapsedTime 2162.33 (36 minutes 2.33 seconds)
SourceFiles 494619
SourceFileSize 8535991560 (7.95 GB)
MirrorFiles 493797
MirrorFileSize 8521756994 (7.94 GB)
NewFiles 1053
NewFileSize 23601632 (22.5 MB)
DeletedFiles 231
DeletedFileSize 10346238 (9.87 MB)
ChangedFiles 572
ChangedSourceSize 86207321 (82.2 MB)
ChangedMirrorSize 85228149 (81.3 MB)
IncrementFiles 1857
IncrementFileSize 13799799 (13.2 MB)
TotalDestinationSizeChange 28034365 (26.7 MB)
Errors 0
....
+
StartTime and EndTime are measured in seconds since the epoch.
ElapsedTime is just EndTime - StartTime, the length of the rdiff-backup
session.
+
SourceFiles are the number of files found in the source directory, and
SourceFileSize is the total size of those files. MirrorFiles are the
number of files found in the mirror directory (not including the
rdiff-backup-data directory) and MirrorFileSize is the total size of
those files. All sizes are in bytes. If the source directory hasn't
changed since the last backup, MirrorFiles == SourceFiles and
SourceFileSize == MirrorFileSize.
+
NewFiles and NewFileSize are the total number and size of the files
found in the source directory but not in the mirror directory. They are
new as of the last backup.
+
DeletedFiles and DeletedFileSize are the total number and size of the
files found in the mirror directory but not the source directory. They
have been deleted since the last backup.
+
ChangedFiles are the number of files that exist both on the mirror and
on the source directories and have changed since the previous backup.
ChangedSourceSize is their total size on the source directory, and
ChangedMirrorSize is their total size on the mirror directory.
+
IncrementFiles is the number of increment files written to the
rdiff-backup-data directory, and IncrementFileSize is their total size.
Generally one increment file will be written for every new, deleted, and
changed file.
+
TotalDestinationSizeChange is the number of bytes the destination
directory as a whole (mirror portion and rdiff-backup-data directory)
has grown during the given rdiff-backup session. This is usually close
to IncrementFileSize + NewFileSize - DeletedFileSize + ChangedSourceSize
- ChangedMirrorSize, but it also includes the space taken up by the
hardlink_data file to record hard links.
. *[#bwlimit]#Is there some way to limit rdiff-backup's bandwidth usage,
as in rsync's --bwlimit option?#*
+
There is no internal rdiff-backup option to do this. However, external
utilities such as http://www.cons.org/cracauer/cstream.html[cstream] can
be used to monitor bandwidth explicitly. trevor@tecnopolis.ca writes:
+
....
rdiff-backup --remote-schema
  'cstream -v 1 -t 10000 | ssh %s '\''rdiff-backup --server'\'' | cstream -t 20000'
  'netbak@foo.bar.com::/mnt/backup' localbakdir

(must run from a bsh-type shell, not a csh type)

That would apply a limit in both directions [10000 bytes/sec outgoing,
20000 bytes/sec incoming].  I don't think you'd ever really want to do
this though as really you just want to limit it in one direction.
Also, note how I only -v 1 in one direction.  You probably don't want
to output stats for both directions as it will confuse whatever script
you have parsing the output.  I guess it wouldn't hurt for manual runs
however.
....
+
To only limit bandwidth in one directory, simply remove one of the
cstream commands. Two cstream caveats may be worth mentioning:
.. Because cstream is limiting the uncompressed data heading into or out
of ssh, if ssh compression is turned on, cstream may be overly
restrictive.
.. cstream may be "bursty", limiting average bandwidth but allowing
rdiff-backup to exceed it for significant periods.
+
Another option is to limit bandwidth at a lower (and perhaps more
appropriate) level. Adam Lazur mentions
http://lartc.org/wondershaper/[The Wonder Shaper].
. *[#leak]#How much memory should rdiff-backup use? Is there a memory
leak?#*
+
The amount of memory rdiff-backup uses should not depend much on the
size of directories being processed. Keeping track of hard links may use
up memory, so if you have, say, hundreds of thousands of files hard
linked together, rdiff-backup may need tens of MB.
+
If rdiff-backup seems to be leaking memory, it is probably because it is
using an early version of librsync. *librsync 0.9.5 leaks lots of
memory.* Later versions should not leak and are available from the
https://sourceforge.net/projects/librsync/[librsync homepage].
. *[#dir_not_empty]#I use NFS and keep getting some error that includes
"OSError: [Errno 39] Directory not empty"#*
+
Several users have reported seeing errors that contain lines like this:
+
....
File "/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/rdiff_backup/rpath.py",
    line 661, in rmdir
OSError: [Errno 39] Directory not empty:
    '/nfs/backup/redfish/win/Program Files/Common Files/GMT/Banners/11132'
Exception exceptions.TypeError: "'NoneType' object is not callable"
     in <bound method GzipFile.__del__ of
....
+
All of these users were backing up onto NFS (Network File System). I
think this is probably a bug in NFS, although tell me if you know how to
make rdiff-backup more NFS-friendly. To avoid this problem, run
rdiff-backup locally on both ends instead of over NFS. This should be
faster anyway.
. *[#regress_failure]#For some reason rdiff-backup failed while backing
up. Now every time it runs it says "regressing destination" and then
fails again. What should I do?#*
+
Firstly, this shouldn't happen. If it does, it indicates a corrupted
destination directory, a bug in rdiff-backup, or some other serious
recurring problem.
+
However, here is a workaround that you might want to use, even though it
probably won't solve the underlying problem: In the destination's
rdiff-backup-data directory, there should be two "current_mirror" files,
for instance:
+
....
current_mirror.2003-09-07T16:43:00-07:00.data
current_mirror.2003-09-08T04:22:01-07:00.data
....
+
Delete the one with the earlier date. Also move the mirror_metadata file
with the later date out of the way, because it probably didn't get
written correctly because that session was aborted:
+
....
mv mirror_metadata.2003-09-08T04:22:01-07:00.snapshot.gz aborted-metadata.2003-09-08T04:22:01-07:00.snapshot.gz
....
+
The next time rdiff-backup runs it won't try regressing the destination.
Metadata will be read from the file system, which may result in some
extra files being backed up, but there shouldn't be any data loss.
. *[#free_space]#Where does rdiff-backup need free space and how much is
required? What is the problem when rdiff-backup says
"`ValueError: Incorrect length of data produced`"?#*
+
When backing up, rdiff-backup needs free space in the mirror directory.
The amount of free space required is usually a bit more than the size of
the file getting backed up, but can be as much as twice the size of the
current file. For instance, suppose you ran `rdiff-backup foo bar` and
the largest file, `foo/largefile`, was 1GB. Then rdiff-backup would need
1+GB of free space in the `bar` directory.
+
When restoring or regressing, rdiff-backup needs free space in the
default temp directory. Under unix systems this is usually the `/tmp`
directory. The temp directory that rdiff-backup uses can be set using
the `--tempdir` and `--remote-tempdir` options available in versions
1.1.13 and newer. See the entry for `tempfile.tempdir` in the
http://www.python.org/doc/2.4.1/lib/module-tempfile.html[Python tempfile
docs] for more information on the default temp directory. The amount of
free space required can vary, but it usually about the size of the
largest file being restored.
+
Usually free space errors are intelligible, like
`IOError: [Errno 28] No space left on device` or similar. However, due
to a gzip quirk they may look like
`ValueError: Incorrect length of data produced`.
. *[#librsync_bug]#What does "internal error: job made no progress"
mean?#*
+
This error happens due to a bug in `librsync` that prevents it from
handling files greater than 4 GB in some situations, such as when
transferring between a 32-bit host and a 64-bit host.
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1439412&group_id=56125&atid=479441[A
patch is available] from the librsync project page on Sourceforge. The
https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=56125[CVS version] of librsync
also contains the patch. More information is also available in
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=355178[Debian bug
report #355178].
. *[#path]#Why does rdiff-backup say it's not in my $PATH? It is when I
login!#*
+
If you get an error like `sh: line1: rdiff-backup: command not found`,
but rdiff-backup _is_ in your `$PATH` when you login to the remote host,
it is happening because the value of bash's `$PATH` is set differently
when you login to an interactive shell than when you run a command
remotely via SSH. For more information, read the
http://linux.die.net/man/1/bash[bash manpage] and look at your `.bashrc`
and `.bash_profile` files.
+
In particular, this can happen if rdiff-backup was installed via Fink on
a remote Mac OS X system. `/sw/bin` is magically added to your `$PATH`
by the script `/sw/bin/init.sh` when you login with an interative shell.
Fink did this behind the scenes when you set it up. Simply add `/sw/bin`
to your path manually, or copy rdiff-backup to a directory that is in
your `$PATH`.
. *[#touple]#What does "`touple index out of range`" mean?#*
+
If you see the error "`tuple index out of range`" after running a
command like: +
 +
`$ rdiff-backup -l /path/to/backup/rdiff-backup-data/` +
 +
then the solution is to simply remove the extra "rdiff-backup-data" from
the end of the path. The list increments option, and others like it,
take the path to the repository, not the path to the rdiff-backup-data
directory. In the above example, you should run again with: +
 +
`$ rdiff-backup -l /path/to/backup` +
 +
If you get this error message for an unrelated reason, try contacting
the mailing list.
. *[#crc]#What does "`IO Error: CRC check failed`" mean?#*
+
This error message means that a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check[Cyclic Redudancy
Check] failed during some operation, most likely while gzip'ing or
un-gzip'ing a file. Possible causes of this error include an incomplete
gzip operation, and hardware failure. A brute-force way to recover from
this error is to remove the rdiff-backup-data directory. However, this
will remove all of your past increments. A better approach may be to
delete the particular file that is causing the problem. A command
like: +
 +
`$ find rdiff-backup-data -type f -name \*.gz -print0 | xargs -0r gzip --test` +
 +
will find the failing file. For more information on this approach, see
this mailing list post:
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/rdiff-backup-users/2007-11/msg00008.html.
. *[#badindex]#What does "`AssertionError: Bad index order`" mean?#*
+
If rdiff-backup fails with the message
"`AssertionError: Bad index order`," it could be because the files in a
directory have changed while rdiff-backup is running. Possible ways of
dealing with this situation include implementing filesystem snapshots
using the volume manager, excluding the offending directory, or
suspending the process that is changing the directory. After the text
"Bad index order", the error messge will indicate which files have
caused the problem.
+
If you get this message for an unreleated reason, try contacting the
mailing list.
. *[#utc]#How can rdiff-backup use UTC as the timezone?#*
+
Like other Unix and Python programs, rdiff-backup respects the `TZ`
environment variable, which can be used to temporarily change the
timezone. On Unix, simply set `TZ=UTC` either in your shell, or on the
command line used to run rdiff-backup. On Windows, the command
`USE TZ=UTC` sets the `%TZ%` environment variable, and can be used
either in a batch script, or at the DOS prompt.
. *[#gui]#What user interfaces are available for rdiff-backup ?#*
+
Two open source projects exist providing a user interface for
rdiff-backup.
+
https://rdiffweb.org[Rdiffweb] is a web interface for rdiff-backup. It
can be used to browse and restore your data from the convenience of your
web browser.
+
https://minarca.org[Minarca] is a centralized backup solution. It
provides an agent to automate the backup process and a server to browse
and restore the data to be installed on your centralized backup server.
The agent is cross-platform allowing you to seamlessly use a single
solution.
