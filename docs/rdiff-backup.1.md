# NAME

**rdiff-backup** â€” local/remote mirror and incremental backup


# SYNOPSIS

| **rdiff-backup** \[options...] _action_ \[_sub-options_...] [_locations_...]
| **rdiff-backup** \[**\--new**] \[**-h**|**\--help**|**-V**|**\--version**]


# DESCRIPTION

rdiff-backup is a script, written in **python**(1) that backs up one directory
to another. The target directory ends up a copy (mirror) of the source
directory, but extra reverse diffs are stored in a special sub-directory of
that target directory, so you can still recover files lost
some time ago. The idea is to combine the best features of a mirror
and an incremental backup. rdiff-backup also preserves symlinks, special files, hardlinks, permissions, uid/gid ownership, and modification
times.

rdiff-backup can also operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a
pipe, like **rsync**(1). Thus you can use ssh and rdiff-backup to securely
back a hard drive up to a remote location, and only the differences
will be transmitted. Using the default settings, rdiff-backup requires
that the remote system accept ssh connections, and that rdiff-backup is
installed in the user's PATH on the remote system.
See the [REMOTE OPERATION](#remote-operation) section for details.

Note that you should not write to the mirror directory except with
rdiff-backup. Many of the increments are stored as reverse diffs, so
if you delete or modify a file, you may lose the ability to restore
previous versions of that file.

Finally, this man page is intended more as a precise description of the
behavior and syntax of rdiff-backup. New users may want to check out
the examples file included in the rdiff-backup distribution.

The rdiff-backup commands knows four types of parameters

1. generic options valid for all actions,
2. one action out of **backup**, **calculate**, **compare**, **info**,
   **list**, **regress**, **remove**, **restore**, **server**, **test**,
   **verify**,
3. sub-options applicable to each action specifically, even though some are
   common to multiple actions,
4. zero, one, two or more location paths, either local or remote.

Note that this documents the _new_ command line interface of rdiff-backup
since 2.1+; for the traditional one, check **rdiff-backup-old(1)** but
consider that it is deprecated and will disappear.

## Options

-h, \--help

:   Prints brief usage information and exits. Add **\--new** to be sure to get
    this CLI description, and not the old one.
    Placed _after_ the action, outputs the action's specific help message.

-V, \--version

:   Prints the current version number and exits.

\--api-version _apiversion_

:   Sets the API version to the given integer between minimum and
    maximum versions as given by the **info** action.
    It is the responsibility of the user to make sure that this version is
    also supported by any server started by this client.

\--chars-to-quote, \--override-chars-to-quote _chars_

:   If the filesystem to which we are backing up is not case-sensitive,
    automatic "quoting" of characters occurs. For example, a file
    '`Developer.doc`' will be converted into '`;068eveloper.doc`'.
    To quote other characters or force quoting, e.g. in case rdiff-backup
    doesn't recognize a case-insensitive file system, you need to specify
    this option. _chars_ is a string of characters fit to be used in regexp
    square brackets (e.g. '`A-Z`' as in '`[A-Z]`').

    **CAUTION:** do NOT change the chars to quote within the same repository!
    Actually, you only need to set this parameter when creating a new backup
    repository. Do also NOT quote any character used by rdiff-backup  in
    rdiff-backup-data (any of 'a-z0-9._-')!

\--current-time _currenttime_

:   This option is useful mainly for testing. If set, rdiff-backup
    will use it for the current time instead of consulting the
    clock. The argument is the number of seconds since the epoch.

\--force

:   Authorize a more drastic modification of a directory than usual
    (for instance, when overwriting of a destination path, or when
    removing multiple sessions with **remove**). rdiff-backup
    will generally tell you if it needs this.

    **CAUTION:** You can cause data loss if you mis-use this option.
    Furthermore, do NOT use this option when doing a restore, as it will
    DELETE files, unless you absolutely know what you are doing.

\--fsync, \--no-fsync

:   This will enable/disable issuing fsync from rdiff-backup altogether.
    This option is designed to optimize performance on busy backup
    systems.

    **CAUTION:** This may render your backup unusable in case of filesystem
    failure. Default is hence for fsync to be enabled.

\--new, \--no-new

:   enforce (or not) the usage of the new parameters. The default currently
    is to show the old usage, but this will change in the near future.

\--null-separator

:   Use nulls (`\0`) instead of newlines (`\n`) as line separators,
    which may help when dealing with filenames containing newlines.
    This affects the expected format of the files specified by the
    **\--{include|exclude}-filelist[-stdin]** switches as well as the
    format of the files statistics.

\--parsable-output

:   If set, rdiff-backup's output will be tailored for easy parsing
    by computers, instead of convenience for humans. Currently this
    only applies when listing increments using the **list increments** action,
    where the time will be given in seconds since the epoch.

\--remote-schema _remoteschema_

:   Specify an alternate method of connecting to a remote computer.
    This is necessary to get rdiff-backup not to use ssh for remote
    backups, or if, for instance, rdiff-backup is not in the PATH on
    the remote side.
    See the [REMOTE OPERATION](#remote-operation) section for details.

\--remote-tempdir _dirpath_

:   use path as temporary directory on the remote side of the connection.

\--restrict-path _dirpath_

:   Require that all file access be inside the given path. This
    switch, and **\--restrict-mode**, are intended to be used with the
    **\--server** switch to provide a bit more protection when doing
    automated remote backups.

    **CAUTION:** Those options are _not_ intended as your only line
    of defense so please don't do something silly like allow public
    access to an rdiff-backup server run with **\--restrict-mode read-only**.

\--restrict-mode {**read-write**,**read-only**,**update-only**}

:   restriction mode for the directory given by **\--restrict-path**, either
    full access (aka read-write), read-only, or only to update incrementally
    an already existing back-up (default is **read-write**).

\--ssh-compression, \--no-ssh-compression

:   use SSH with or without compression with default remote-schema.  This
    option is ignored when using **\--remote-schema**. Compression is on by
    default.

\--tempdir _dirpath_

:   Sets the directory that rdiff-backup uses for temporary files to
    the given path. The environment variables TMPDIR, TEMP, and TMP
    can also be used to set the temporary files directory. See the
    documentation of the Python tempfile module for more information.

\--terminal-verbosity {**0**,**1**,**2**,**3**,**4**,**5**,**6**,**7**,**8**,**9**}

:   select which verbosity to use for messages on the terminal,
    the default is given by **\--verbosity**.

\--use-compatible-timestamps

:   Create timestamps in which the hour/minute/second separator is a
    - (hyphen) instead of a : (colon). It is safe to use this option
    on one backup, and then not use it on another; rdiff-backup supports
    the intermingling of different timestamp formats. This option is enabled
    by default on platforms which require that the colon be escaped.

-v, \--verbosity {**0**,**1**,**2**,**3**,**4**,**5**,**6**,**7**,**8**,**9**}

:   Specify verbosity level (0 is totally silent, 3 is the default,
    and 9 is noisiest). This determines how much is written to the
    log file, and without using **\--terminal-verbosity** to the terminal..

## Actions

backup [[CREATION OPTIONS](#creation-options)] [[COMPRESSION OPTIONS](#compression-options)] [[SELECTION OPTIONS](#selection-options)] [[FILESYSTEM OPTIONS](#filesystem-options)] [[USER GROUP OPTIONS](#user-group-options)] [[STATISTICS OPTIONS](#statistics-options)] _sourcedir_ _targetdir_

:   back-up a source directory to a target backup repository.

calculate [\--method **average**] _statfile1_ _statfile2_ [...]

:   calculate average across multiple statistics files

    \--method **average**

    :   there is currently only one method and it is the default, but it might
        change in the future.

compare [[SELECTION OPTIONS](#selection-options)] [\--method _method_] [\--at _time_] _sourcedir_ _targetdir_

:   Compare a directory with the backup set at the given time. This
    can be useful to see how archived data differs from current
    data, or to check that a backup is current.

    \--method _method_

    :   method used to compare can be either **meta**, **full** or **hash**,
        where the default is **meta**, which is also how rdiff-backup decides
        which file needs to be backed-up. Note that with **full**, the
        repository data will be copied in its entirety to the source side and
        compared byte by byte. This is the slowest but most complete compare
        method. With **hash** only the SHA1 checksum of regular files will be
        compared. With **meta** only the metadata of files will be compared
        (name, size, date, type, etc).

    \--at _time_

    :   at which _time_ of the back-up directory should the comparaison take
        place. The default is **now**, meaning the latest version.
	See [TIME FORMATS](#time-formats) for details.

info

:   outputs information about the current system in YAML format, so that it
    can be used in a bug report, and exits.

list **files** [**\--changed-since** _time_|**\--at** _time_] _repository_

:   list modified or existing files in a given back-up repository.

    \--changed-since _time_

    :   List the files that have changed in the destination directory
        since the given time. See TIME FORMATS for the format of time.
        If a directory in the archive is specified, list only the files
        under that directory. This option does not read the source
        directory; it is used to compare the contents of two different
        rdiff-backup sessions.
	See [TIME FORMATS](#time-formats) for details.

    \--at _time_

    :   List the files in the archive that were present at the given
        time. If a directory in the archive is specified, list only the
        files under that directory.
	See [TIME FORMATS](#time-formats) for details.

list **increments** [**\--no-size**|**\--size**] _repository_

:   list increments with date in a given back-up repository.

    \--no-size,\--size

    :   Show or not the size of each increment in the repository. The default
        is to _not_ show sizes. When showing sizes, it becomes allowable to
        specify a directory within a repository, then only the cumulated
        sizes of that directory will be shown.

regress [[COMPRESSION OPTIONS](#compression-options)] [[USER GROUP OPTIONS](#user-group-options)] [[TIMESTAMP OPTIONS](#timestamp-options)] _repository_

:   If an rdiff-backup session fails, this action will undo the failed
    directory. This happens automatically if you attempt to back-up to a
    directory and the last backup failed.

remove **increments** **\--older-than** _time_

:   Remove the incremental backup information in the destination directory
    that has been around longer than the given time, or the oldest one if
    no time is provided.

    By default, rdiff-backup will only delete information from one
    session at a time. To remove two or more sessions at the same
    time, supply the **\--force** option (rdiff-backup will tell you if
    it is required).

    Note that snapshots of deleted files are covered by this operation.
    Thus if you deleted a file two weeks ago, backed up immediately
    afterwards, and then ran rdiff-backup with
    '`remove increments --older-than 10D`' today, no trace of that file
    would remain.

    \--older-than _time_

    :   all the increments older than the given time will be deleted.
        See [TIME FORMATS](#time-formats) for details.

restore [[CREATION OPTIONS](#creation-options)] [[COMPRESSION OPTIONS](#compression-options-options)] [[SELECTION OPTIONS](#selection-options)] [[FILESYSTEM OPTIONS](#filesystem-options)] [[USER GROUP OPTIONS](#user-group-options)] [**\--at** _time_|**\--increment**] _source_ _targetdir_

:   restore a source backup repository at a specific time or a specific
    source increment to a target directory.
    See [RESTORING](#restoring) for details.

    \--at _time_

    :   the _source_ parameter is interpreted as a back-up directory, and
        the content is restored from the given time.
        See [TIME FORMATS](#time-formats) for details.

    \--increment

    :   the _source_ parameter is expected to be an increment within a
        back-up repository, to be restored into the given target directory.

server

:   Enter server mode (not to be invoked directly, but instead used
    by another rdiff-backup process on a remote computer).

test _remote_location_1_ [_remote_location_2_ ...]

:   Test for the presence of a compatible rdiff-backup server as
    specified in the following remote location argument(s) (of which
    the filename section will be ignored).
    See the [REMOTE OPERATION](#remote-operation) section for details.

verify **\--at** _time_ _location_

:   Check all the data in the repository at the given time by computing
    the SHA1 hash of all the regular files and comparing them
    with the hashes stored in the metadata file.

    \--at _time_

    :   the time of the data which needs to be verified.
        See [TIME FORMATS](#time-formats) for details.


# COMPRESSION OPTIONS

\--compression, \--no-compression

:   Disable the default gzip compression of most of the `.snapshot`
    and `.diff` increment files stored in the rdiff-backup-data directory.
    A backup volume can contain compressed and uncompressed
    increments, so using this option inconsistently is fine. 

\--not-compressed-regexp _regexp_

:   Do not compress increments based on files whose filenames match
    regexp. The default includes many common audiovisual and archive
    files, and may be found from the help.

# CREATION OPTIONS

\--create-full-path

:   Normally only the final directory of the destination path will
    be created if it does not exist. With this option, all missing
    directories on the destination path will be created. Use this
    option with care: if there is a typo in the remote path, the remote
    filesystem could fill up very quickly (by creating a duplicate
    backup tree). For this reason this option is primarily aimed at
    scripts which automate backups.

# FILESYSTEM OPTIONS

\--acls, \--no-acls

:   enable/disable back-up of Access Control Lists.

\--carbonfile, \--no-carbonfile

:   enable/disable back-up of carbon files (MacOS X).

\--eas, \--no-eas

:   enable/disable back-up of Extended Attributes.

\--resource-forks, \--no-resource-forks

:   enable/disable back-up of resource forks (MacOS X).

\--hard-links, \--no-hard-links

:   do (or not) keep hard-link relationships between files.
    Disabling hard-links generally increases the disk space usage
    but decreases memory usage. Hard-links are disabled by
    default if the backup source or restore destination is
    running on native Windows.

\--compare-inode, \--no-compare-inode

:   This option prevents rdiff-backup from flagging a
    hardlinked file as changed when its device number and/or
    inode changes. This option is useful in situations where
    the source filesystem lacks persistent device and/or inode
    numbering. For example, network filesystems may have
    mount-to-mount differences in their device number (but
    possibly stable inode numbers); USB/1394 devices may come
    up at different device numbers each remount (but would
    generally have same inode number); and there are filesystems
    which don't even have the same inode numbers from
    use to use. Without the option rdiff-backup may generate
    unnecessary numbers of tiny diff files.

\--never-drop-acls

:   Exit with error instead of dropping ACLs or ACL entries.
    Normally this may happen (with a warning) because the
    destination does not support them or because the relevant
    user/group names do not exist on the destination side.

# SELECTION OPTIONS

This section only quickly lists the existing options, the section
[FILE SELECTION](#file-selection) explains those more in details.

## Globs, Regex, File lists selection

\--include,\--exclude _glob_

:   Include/exclude the file or files matched by _glob_ (also known as shell
    pattern). If a directory is excluded, then files under that directory
    will also be excluded.

\--include-globbing-filelist,\--exclude-globbing-filelist _globsfile_

:  Include/exclude according to the listed globs, similar to **\--include**
   or **\--exclude**.

\--include-globbing-filelist-stdin,\--exclude-globbing-filelist-stdin

:   Like the previous option but the list of globs is coming from
    standard input.

\--include-regexp,\--exclude-regexp _regexp_

:   Include/exclude files matching the given regexp (according to Python
    rules).

\--include-filelist,\--exclude-filelist _listfile_

:   Include/exclude the files listed in _filelist_. This is a best fit for
    an automatically generated list of files, else use globbing.

\--include-filelist-stdin,\--exclude-filelist-stdin

:   Like the previous but the filelist is coming from standard input.

## Special files selection

**NOTE:** All special files are included by default, so that including them
explicitly isn't generally required. Exceptions are described.

\--include-device-files,\--exclude-device-files

:   Include/exclude all device files. This can be useful for
    security/permissions reasons or if rdiff-backup is not handling device
    files correctly.

\--include-fifos,\--exclude-fifos

:   Include/exclude all fifo files.

\--include-sockets,\--exclude-sockets

:   Include/exclude all socket files.

\--include-symbolic-links,\--exclude-symbolic-links

:   Include/exclude all symbolic links.
    Contrary to the general rule, symlinks are excluded by default under
    Windows so that NTFS reparse points aren't backed-up.

\--include-special-files,\--exclude-special-files

:   Include/exclude all the special files listed above.

## Other selections

\--include-other-filesystems,\--exclude-other-filesystems

:   Include/exclude files on file systems (identified by device number)
    other than the file system the root of the source directory is on.
    The default is to include other filesystems.

\--include-if-present,\--exclude-if-present _filename_

:   Include/exclude directories if they contain the given _filename_.

\--max-file-size _sizeinbytes_

:   Exclude files that are larger than the given size in bytes.

\--min-file-size _sizeinbytes_

:   Exclude files that are smaller than the given size in bytes.


# STATISTICS OPTIONS

\--file-statistics, \--no-file-statistics

:   Enable/disable writing to the '`file_statistics`' file in
    the rdiff-backup-data directory. rdiff-backup will run
    slightly quicker and take up a bit less space.
    Default is to write the statistics file(s).

    See the [FILES](#files) section for more information about
    statistics files.

\--no-print-statistics, \--print-statistics

:   Summary statistics will be printed (or not) after a successful backup.
    Even if disabled (the default), this information will still be available
    from the session statistics file.

# TIMESTAMP OPTIONS

\--allow-duplicate-timestamps

:   This option is only to be used if you encounter the issue
    of metadata mirrors with the same timestamp. In such
    cases, you may use this flag to first recover from the
    failed backup with something like

         rdiff-backup --allow-duplicate-timestamps \
                      --check-destination-dir {targetdir}

    after which you will need to remove those old duplicate
    entries using the **remove increments** action. 

# USER GROUP OPTIONS

See the [USERS AND GROUPS](#users-and-groups) section for more information.

\--group-mapping-file _mapfile_

:   Map group names and IDs according to the group mapping file _mapfile_.

\--user-mapping-file _mapfile_

:   Map user names and IDs according to the user mapping file _mapfile_.

\--preserve-numerical-ids

:   If set, rdiff-backup will preserve uids/gids instead of
    trying to preserve unames and gnames.

# RESTORING

There are two ways to tell rdiff-backup to restore a file or directory:

1. you can run rdiff-backup **restore** on a mirror file and define
   a time from which to restore (by default the latest one).
2. you can run the **restore** action on an increment file with the
   sub-option **\--increment**.

For example, suppose in the past you have run:

    rdiff-backup backup /usr /usr.backup

to back up the '`/usr`' directory into the '`/usr.backup`' directory, and
now want a copy of the '`/usr/local`' directory the way it was 3 days
ago placed at '`/usr/local.old`'.

One way to do this is to run:

    rdiff-backup restore --at 3D /usr.backup/local /usr/local.old

where above the "3D" means 3 days (for other ways to specify the
time, see the [TIME FORMATS](#time-formats) section). The
'`/usr.backup/local`' directory was selected, because that is the
directory containing the current version of '`usr/local`'.

Note that the parameter of **\--at** always specifies an exact
time. (So "3D" refers to the moment 72 hours before the present).
If there was no backup made at that time, rdiff-backup restores the
state recorded for the previous backup. For instance, in the above
case, if "3D" is used, and there are only backups from 2 days and 4
days ago, '`/usr/local`' as it was 4 days ago will be restored.

The second way to restore files involves finding the corresponding
increment file. It would be in the
'`/backup/rdiff-backup-data/increments/usr`'
directory, and its name would be something like
'`local.2002-11-09T12:43:53-04:00.dir`' where the time indicates it is
from 3 days ago. Note that the increment files all end in '`.diff`',
'`.snapshot`', '`.dir`', or '`.missing`', where '`.missing`' just means that
the file didn't exist at that time (finally, some of these may be
gzip-compressed, and have an extra '`.gz`' to indicate this). Then
running:

    rdiff-backup restore --increment \
        /backup/rdiff-backup-data/increments/usr/local.{time}.dir \
        /usr/local.old

would also restore the file as desired.

If you are not sure exactly which version of a file you need, it is
probably easiest to either restore from the increments files as described
immediately above, or to see which increments are available
with '`list increments`', and then specify an exact time with **\--at**.

# TIME FORMATS

rdiff-backup uses time strings in two places.

Firstly, all of the increment files rdiff-backup creates will have
the time in their filenames in the w3 datetime format as described
in a w3 note at <https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime>.
Basically they look like
"2001-07-15T04:09:38-07:00", which is basically
"{Year}-{Month}-{Day}T{Hours}:{Minutes}:{Seconds}{Timezone}",
the time zone being 7 hours _behind_ UTC in this example (hence the minus).

Secondly, the **\--at**, **\--changed-since**, **\--older-than** options
take a time string, which can be given in any of several formats:

1. the string "now" (refers to the current time)

2. a sequences of digits, like "123456890" (indicating the time
   in seconds after the epoch)

3. A string like "2002-01-25T07:00:00+02:00" in datetime format

4. An interval, which is a number followed by one of the characters
   s, m, h, D, W, M, or Y (indicating seconds, minutes,
   hours, days, weeks, months, or years respectively), or a series
   of such pairs. In this case the string refers to the
   time that preceded the current time by the length of the interval.
   For instance, "1h78m" indicates the time that was
   one hour and 78 minutes ago. The calendar here is unsophisticated:
   a month is always 30 days, a year is always 365
   days, and a day is always 86400 seconds.

5. A date format of the form "YYYY/MM/DD", "YYYY-MM-DD", "MM/DD/YYYY",
   or "MM-DD-YYYY", which indicates midnight on the day in question,
   relative to the current timezone settings. For instance,
   "2002/3/5", "03-05-2002", and "2002-3-05" all mean
   March 5th, 2002 (needless to say that starting with the year is less
   confusing for non-Americans).

6. A backup session specification which is a non-negative integer
   followed by '`B`'. For instance, '`0B`' specifies the time
   of the current mirror, and '`3B`' specifies the time of the 3rd
   newest increment.

# REMOTE OPERATION

In order to access remote files, rdiff-backup opens up a pipe to a
copy of rdiff-backup running on the remote machine. Thus rdiff-backup
must be installed on both ends. To open this pipe, rdiff-backup
first splits the location into '`host_info::pathname`'. It then
substitutes '`host_info`' into the remote schema, and runs the resulting
command, reading its input and output.

The default remote schema is '`ssh -C {h} rdiff-backup --server`' where
'`host_info`' is substituted for '`{h}`'. So if the '`host_info`' is
'`user@host.net`', then rdiff-backup runs
'`ssh user@host.net rdiff-backup --server`'. Using **\--remote-schema**,
rdiff-backup can invoke an arbitrary command in order to open up a
remote pipe. For instance,

    rdiff-backup backup --remote-schema 'cd /usr; {h}' \
                        foo 'rdiff-backup --server'::bar

is basically equivalent to (but slower than)

    rdiff-backup backup foo /usr/bar

Concerning quoting, if for some reason you need to put two consecutive
colons in the '`host_info`' section of a '`host_info::pathname`' argument,
or in the pathname of a local file, you can quote one of them
by prepending a backslash. So in '`a\::b::c`', '`host_info`' is '`a::b`'
and the pathname is '`c`'. Similarly, if you want to refer to a local
file whose filename contains two consecutive colons, like
'`strange::file`', you'll have to quote one of the colons as in
'`strange\::file`'. Because the backslash is a quote character in
these circumstances, it too must be quoted to get a literal backslash,
so '`foo\::\\bar`' evaluates to '`foo::\bar`'. To make things
more complicated, because the backslash is also a common shell quoting
character, you may need to type in '`\\\\`' at the shell prompt to
get a literal backslash.

You may also use the placehoders '`{vx}`', '`{vy}`' and '`{vz}`' for
the '`x.y.z`' version of rdiff-backup, so that you can have multiple
versions of rdiff-backup installed on the server, and automatically
targeted from the client.

For example, if you have rdiff-backup 2.1.5 and 2.2.1 installed in
virtual environments on the server, respectively under
'`/usr/local/lib/rdiff-backup-2.0`' and '`/usr/local/lib/rdiff-backup-2.1`'
(we assume that the z-Version isn't relevant to any kind of compatibility),
then the client may be called with the following remote schema:

    ssh -C {h} /usr/local/lib/rdiff-backup-{vx}.{vy} --server

The client will then use the correct version of rdiff-backup based on
its own version '`x.y.z`'. You'll find more explanations in the
**migration.md** file in the documentation.

And finally, to include a literal '`%`' in the string specified by
**\--remote-schema**, quote it with another '`%`', as in '`%%`'
(this is due to the compatibility with the deprecated host placeholder
'`%s`', which you shouldn't use anymore).

Although ssh itself may be secure, using rdiff-backup in the default
way presents some security risks. For instance if the server is run
as root, then an attacker who compromised the client could then use
rdiff-backup to overwrite arbitrary server files by "backing up"
over them. Such a setup can be made more secure by using the sshd
configuration option '`command="rdiff-backup --server"`' possibly along
with the **\--restrict-path** and **\--restrict-mode** options to
rdiff-backup. For more information, see the web page, the wiki, and the
entries for those options on this man page.

# FILE SELECTION

rdiff-backup has a number of file selection options. When
rdiff-backup is run, it searches through the given source directory
and backs up all the files matching the specified options.
This selection system may appear complicated, but it is supposed
to be flexible and easy-to-use. If you just want to learn the
basics, first look at the selection examples in the examples.html
file included in the package, or on the web at
<https://rdiff-backup.net/docs/examples.html>.

rdiff-backup's selection system was originally inspired by
**rsync**(1), but there are many differences. For instance, trailing
backslashes have no special significance.

**IMPORTANT:** include and exclude patterns under Windows solely support
slashes '`/`' as file separators, given that backslashes '`\`' have a
special meaning in regex/glob patterns.

All the available file selection conditions are listed under
[SELECTION OPTIONS](#selection-options).

Two principles need to be understood before really starting:

1. pattern matching is stupid about paths, it just does pattern matching and
   can't interpret patterns like path, especially it can't resolve absolute
   into relative paths and vice-versa (compare with the '`-path`' option of
   find).
2. pattern matching is done on the complete path of each found file (no partial
   matching and no file name matching).
   Beware that complete path does _not_ mean full path, it can be a complete
   relative path.

For example, the pattern '`bar`' matches the path '`bar`', but doesn't match
the path '`foo/bar`' and neither the path '`./bar`'. Both are matched by the
pattern '`*/bar`', as well as by '`**/bar`'. This last pattern would match
any path containing the file '`bar`', e.g. '`foo/boz/bar`'.

Each file selection condition either matches or doesn't match a given
file. A given file is excluded by the file selection system exactly when
the first matching file selection condition specifies that the file
be excluded; otherwise the file is included. When backing up,
if a file is excluded, rdiff-backup acts as if that file does
not exist in the source directory. When restoring, an excluded
file is considered not to exist in either the source or target
directories.

For instance,

    rdiff-backup backup --include /usr \
                        --exclude /usr /usr /backup

is exactly the same as

    rdiff-backup backup /usr /backup

because the include and exclude directives match exactly the
same files, and the **\--include** comes first, giving it precedence.
Similarly,

    rdiff-backup backup --include /usr/local/bin \
                        --exclude /usr/local /usr /backup

would backup the '`/usr/local/bin`' directory (and its contents),
but not '`/usr/local/doc`'.

The include, exclude, include-globbing-filelist, and exclude-globbing-filelist
options accept extended shell globbing patterns.
These patterns can contain the special patterns '`*`', '`**`',
'`?`', and '`[...]`'. As in a normal shell, '`*`' can be expanded to any
string of characters not containing '`/`', '`?`' expands to any character
except '`/`', and '`[...]`' expands to a single character of
those characters specified (ranges are acceptable). The new
special pattern, '`**`', expands to any string of characters whether
or not it contains '`/`'. Furthermore, if the pattern starts with
'`ignorecase:`' (case insensitive), then this prefix will be removed
and any character in the string can be replaced with an
upper- or lowercase version of itself.

If you need to match filenames which contain the above globbing
characters, they may be escaped using a backslash '`\`'. The backslash
will only escape the character following it so for '`**`' you
will need to use '`\*\*`' to avoid escaping it to the '`*`' globbing
character.

Remember that you may need to quote these characters when typing
them into a shell, so the shell does not interpret the globbing
patterns before rdiff-backup sees them.

The **\--exclude** _pattern_ option matches a file if and only if:

1. pattern can be expanded into the file's filename, or

2. the file is inside a directory matched by the option.

Conversely, **\--include** _pattern_ matches a file if and only if:

1. pattern can be expanded into the file's filename,

2. the file is inside a directory matched by the option, or

3. the file is a directory which contains a file matched by
    the option.

For example,

    --exclude /usr/local

matches '`/usr/local`', '`/usr/local/lib`', and '`/usr/local/lib/netscape`'.
It is the same as

    --exclude /usr/local --exclude '/usr/local/**'

And similarly:

    --include /usr/local

specifies that '`/usr`', '`/usr/local`', '`/usr/local/lib`', and
'`/usr/local/lib/netscape`' (but not '`/usr/doc`') all be backed up.
Thus you don't have to worry about including parent directories to make
sure that included subdirectories have somewhere to go. Finally,

    --include ignorecase:'/usr/[a-z0-9]foo/*/**.py'

would match a file like '`/usr/5fOO/hello/there/world.py`'. If it
did match anything, it would also match '`/usr`'. If there is no
existing file that the given pattern can be expanded into, the
option will not match '`/usr`'.

The **\--include-filelist**, **\--exclude-filelist**,
**\--include-filelist-stdin**, and **\--exclude-filelist-stdin**
options also introduce file selection conditions.
They direct rdiff-backup to read in a file, each line of which is
a file specification, and to include
or exclude the matching files. Lines are separated by newlines
or nulls, depending on whether the **\--null-separator** switch was
given. Each line in a filelist is interpreted similarly to the
way extended shell patterns are, with a few exceptions:

1. Globbing patterns like '`*`', '`**`', '`?`', and '`[...]`' are not expanded.
'
2. Include patterns do not match files in a directory that
   is included. So '`/usr/local`' in an include file will not
   match '`/usr/local/doc`'.

3. Lines starting with '<code>+ [...]</code>' (plus followed by a space) are
   interpreted as include directives, even if found in a filelist referenced by
   **\--exclude-filelist**.
   Similarly, lines starting with '<code>- [...]</code>' (minus followed by a
   space) exclude files even if they are found within an include filelist.

For example, if the file '`list.txt`' contains the lines:

    /usr/local
    - /usr/local/doc
    /usr/local/bin
    + /var
    - /var

then '`--include-filelist list.txt`' would include '`/usr`',
'`/usr/local`', and '`/usr/local/bin`'. It would exclude '`/usr/local/doc`',
'`/usr/local/doc/python`', etc. It neither excludes nor includes
'`/usr/local/man`', leaving the fate of this directory to the next
specification condition. Finally, it is undefined what happens
with `'/var`'. A single file list should not contain conflicting
file specifications.

The **\--include-globbing-filelist** and **\--exclude-globbing-filelist**
options also specify filelists, but each line in the filelist
will be interpreted as a globbing pattern the way **\--include** and
**\--exclude** options are interpreted (although '`+ `' and '`- `'
prefixing is still allowed). For instance, if the file
'`globbing-list.txt`' contains the lines:

    dir/foo

Then '`--include-globbing-filelist globbing-list.txt`' would be
exactly the same as specifying on the command line:

    --include dir/foo --include dir/bar --exclude **

Finally, the **\--include-regexp** and **\--exclude-regexp** allow files
to be included and excluded if their filenames match a python
regular expression. Regular expression syntax is too complicated
to explain here, but is covered in Python's library reference.
Unlike the **\--include** and **\--exclude** options, the regular
expression options don't match files containing or contained in
matched files. So for instance

    --include '[0-9]{7}(?!foo)'

matches any files whose full pathnames contain 7 consecutive
digits which aren't followed by 'foo'. However, it wouldn't
match '`/home`' even if '`/home/ben/1234567`' existed.

# USERS AND GROUPS

There can be complications preserving ownership across systems.
For instance the username that owns a file on the source system
may not exist on the destination. Here is how rdiff-backup maps
ownership on the source to the destination (or vice-versa, in
the case of restoring):

1. If the **\--preserve-numerical-ids** option is given, the remote
   files will always have the same uid and gid, both
   for ownership and ACL entries. This may cause unames and
   gnames to change.

2. Otherwise, attempt to preserve the user and group names
   for ownership and in ACLs. This may result in files having
   different uids and gids across systems.

3. If a name cannot be preserved (e.g. because the username
   does not exist), preserve the original id, but only in
   cases of user and group ownership. For ACLs, omit any
   entry that has a bad user or group name.

4. The **\--user-mapping-file** and **\--group-mapping-file** options
   override this behavior. If either of these options is
   given, the policy described in 2 and 3 above will be followed,
   but with the mapped user and group instead of the
   original. If you specify both **\--preserve-numerical-ids**
   and one of the mapping options, the behavior is undefined.

The user and group mapping files both have the same format:

    old_name_or_id1:new_name_or_id1
    old_name_or_id2:new_name_or_id2
    [...etc...]

Each line should contain a name or id, followed by a colon '`:`',
followed by another name or id. If a name or id is not listed,
they are treated in the default way described above.

When restoring, the above behavior is also followed, but note
that the original source user/group information will be the input,
not the already mapped user/group information present in
the backup repository. For instance, suppose you have mapped
all the files owned by alice in the source so that they are
owned by ben in the repository, and now you want to restore,
making sure the files owned originally by alice are still owned
by alice. In this case there is no need to use any of the mapping
options. However, if you wanted to restore the files so
that the files originally owned by alice on the source are now
owned by ben, you would have to use the mapping options, even
though you just want the unames of the repository's files preserved
in the restored files.

See [USER GROUP OPTIONS](#user-group-options) for a list and description
of related options.

# FILES

_any-config-file_

:   you can create a file with one option/action/sub-option per line and
    use it on the command line with an ampersand prefix like
    _\@any-config-file_ and its content
    will be interpreted as if given on the command line.

    For example, creating a file '`mybackup`' with following content:

    ```
    --verbosity
    5
    backup
    source_dir
    target_dir
    ```

    and calling '`rdiff-backup @mybackup`' will be the same as calling
    '`rdiff-backup --verbosity 5 backup source_dir target_dir`'.

**session_statistics**, **file_statistics**

:   Every session rdiff-backup saves various statistics into two
    files, the session statistics file at
    '`rdiff-backup-data/session_statistics.{datetime}.data`'
    and the files statistics at
    '`rdiff-backup-data/directory_statistics.{datetime}.data`'.
    They are both text files and contain similar information: how many files
    changed, how many were deleted, the total size of increment
    files created, etc. However, the session statistics file is intended
    to be very readable and only describes the session as a
    whole. The files statistics file is more compact (and
    slightly less readable) but describes every directory backed up.
    It also may be compressed to save space.

    See also [STATISTICS OPTIONS](#statistics-options) and the
    **\--null-separator** option.

**backup.log**, **restore.log**, **error_log**

:   rdiff-backup will save various messages to the log file,
    which is '`rdiff-backup-data/backup.log`' for backup sessions and
    '`rdiff-backup-data/restore.log`' for restore sessions. Generally
    what is written to this file will coincide with the messages
    displayed to stdout or stderr, although this can be changed with
    the **\--terminal-verbosity** option.

    Errors during backup are also written to a file
    '`rdiff-backup-data/error_log.{datetime}.data`'.

    The log files are not compressed and can become quite large if
    rdiff-backup is run with high verbosity.


# ENVIRONMENT

**RDIFF_BACKUP_VERBOSITY**=_[0-9]_

:   the default verbosity for log file and terminal, can be
    overwritten by the corresponding options **-v/\--verbosity** and
    **\--terminal-verbosity**.
