= Building this site with Jekyll

(still very much WiP)

We're assuming ruby, gem and bundler are already installed on one's system.

----
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll build .
# or bundle exec jekyll serve .
----

NOTE: make sure that each README.adoc is soft-linked to an index.adoc.
The first one is understood by GitHub as landing page for a directory.
The 2nd one is rendered as regular file by Jekyll, and understood as well as default page for a directory then.
