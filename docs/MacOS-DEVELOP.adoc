Some notes for developers and contributors willing to help with rdiff-backup development on macOS, or simply compile rdiff-backup from source code.

== Pre-requisites

Here is the list of components required to develop or compile rdiff-backup on macOS.

=== Installing Python on macOS

On macOS, you have two main options for installing Python.

NOTE: The `universal2` format allows a single binary to run natively on both x86_64 (Intel) and arm64 (Apple Silicon M1,M2,M3) architectures. This is especially helpful when distributing Python scripts or applications across various Mac environments. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_binary#Universal_2

==== Option 1: Download from the Official Python Website (recommended)

Visit the official Python downloads page for macOS:

https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/

- Choose the installer labeled `macOS 64-bit universal2 installer`.
- This version includes support for both Intel and Apple Silicon processors.
- It installs Python under `/usr/local/bin/python3` (you may need to update your PATH).

==== Option 2: Install via Homebrew

If you use Homebrew, you can install Python with:

On macOS, you have two main options to install Python:

- Install via Homebrew: `brew install python`

==== Verify that Python was installed correctly:

[source,shell]
----
which python3
python3 --version
----

=== Install Required Build Tools

You may need the following tools for building native libraries:

[source,shell]
----
xcode-select --install
----

=== Build and Install librsync from Source

1. Clone or download the librsync source from GitHub:  
   https://github.com/rdiff-backup/librsync

2. Build and install it:

[source,shell]
----
wget https://github.com/librsync/librsync/releases/download/v2.3.4/librsync-2.3.4.tar.gz
tar zxvf librsync-2.3.4.tar.gz
cd librsync
cmake .
make
sudo make install
----

This should install `librsync` in `/usr/local/lib` and headers in `/usr/local/include`.

To confirm installation:

[source,shell]
----
ls /usr/local/lib | grep rsync
----

== Build, Test and Package rdiff-backup

Now you can clone and set up the rdiff-backup source tree:

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/rdiff-backup/rdiff-backup
cd rdiff-backup
----

=== Create and Activate Virtual Environment

[source,shell]
----
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
----

Ensure you're using the virtual environment's Python, verify that `python3` is within the venv folder:

[source,shell]
----
which python3
----

=== Set Library Path (for dynamic linker)

[source,shell]
----
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
----

=== Install Dependencies and Editable Package

[source,shell]
----
pip install -e .
----

This installs rdiff-backup in editable mode along with development dependencies.

=== Run Tests

[source,shell]
----
make test
----

=== Build the Package

To build a source distribution and wheel:

[source,shell]
----
pyproject-build
----

Artifacts will be created in the `dist/` directory.

== Troubleshooting

- If Python cannot find `librsync`, make sure `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` is exported properly.
- Use `otool -L dist/rdiff-backup` to inspect dynamic library dependencies.
