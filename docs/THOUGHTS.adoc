= Thoughts for code evolution

As I go through a major rewrite and see things I don't like, or would like to improve, a place to store easily such thoughts:

- get rid of a maximum of global variables
- split truly global (also remote) from local singletons
- renumber verbosities to avoid "holes" between 0 and 9
- replace log verbosity with IntEnum
- replace return codes with IntFlag
- split logging mechanism between front-end and back-end (writing to file, which is specific to the repository format)
- replace own Logger implementation with standard one (in the background)
- extend runtime info to also check locations and output file system information
- set api version to 300 (or 290-299 to start with)
- make check and setup functions mostly remote to encapsulate repo structure
- use shadow object instead of shadow class, at least locally, to have more repeatable runs within same context?
- allow keyword type parameters across the connection keyword=value
- go through all the functions and make sure their names are more consistent
- merge somehow the ErrorLog and Log functionalities to have one single interface
- check all tests and make sure that they don't generate uncaptured exceptions in rdiff-backup, capture them and make messages user friendly/ier
- add unnecessary keyword parameters to simplify unit testing of shadow classes (as done for the locking functions)
- write security concept paper
- re-write security module to fit better new concepts around remote dir/repo, especially update-only doesn't block backup to a new directory anymore. Possibly split _Repo_Shadow into Read and Write variants.
- rewrite QuotedRPath to be an RPath variant specific to repositories, to encapsulate the increment aspects & co (taking them out of the standard RPath class)
- does statistics really need direct access to the get_increment function? Or could it use the (shadow) repo as back-end like thought for logs?
- add https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#argument-groups to arguments coming from actions
- pass null_separator to selection functions
- get rid of usage of selection module in fs_abilities
- generic variable preserve_atime isn't modified anywhere
- simplify usage of connections and connection_dict (get rid of one of both?)
- get rid of the backup_writer variables (in singleton/specifics), replace with log/stats access to repository
- get rid of compression as generics variable, replacing with usage of values.
- replace null_separator with something like line_separator, directly having the character
- replace all usage of print through log.Log
