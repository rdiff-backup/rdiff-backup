= Thoughts for code evolution

As I go through a major rewrite and see things I don't like, or would like to improve, a place to store easily such thoughts:

- get rid of a maximum of global variables
- split truly global (also remote) from local singletons
- renumber verbosities to avoid "holes" between 0 and 9
- replace log verbosity with IntEnum
- replace return codes with IntFlag
- split logging mechanism between front-end and back-end (writing to file, which is specific to the repository format)
- replace own Logger implementation with standard one (in the background)
- extend runtime info to also check locations and output file system information
- set api version to 300
- move creation of self._shadow to __init__ of locations
- make check and setup functions mostly remote to encapsulate repo structure
