= Development Guide for rdiff-backup

Some notes for developers and other people willing to help development.

== Testing rdiff-backup

- Install:
* tox
* libacl-devel (for sys/acl.h)
* rdiff
* python3-setuptools (for setup.py)
- unpack the test files previously available from
https://download-mirror.savannah.gnu.org/releases/rdiff-backup/testfiles.tar.gz and now temporarily available as
release under https://github.com/ericzolf/rdiff-backup/releases[]:
* The extraction as root (e.g. `sudo tar xvzf rdiff-backup_testfiles_ISORELEASEDATE.tar.gz`) is sadly necessary
because else the device files won't be extracted as normal user. This needs to happen in the _parent_ directory
of the Git directory.
* You then possibly need to fix (again as root) the access rights so that the user/group you're using normally in your
daily development life is set instead of my user and group with ID 1000. For this you may use the helper script
provided in the archive and call `sudo ./rdiff-backup_testfiles.fix.sh`.

That's it, you can now run the tests:

- run `tox` to use the default `tox.ini`
- or `tox -c tox_slow.ini` for long tests
- or `sudo tox -c tox_root.ini` for the few tests needing root rights

== How to debug rdiff-backup?

=== Trace back a coredump

As I write those notes, I have an issue where calling the program generates a `Segmentation fault (core dumped)`. At this stage, this document is just some notes taken as I'm trying to debug this problem under Fedora (29).

NOTE: I assume gdb was already installed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
<1> see below for the purpose of this and the following lines

Then calling:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
python3 dist/setup.py clean --all  #<1>
python3-debug dist/setup.py clean --all
CFLAGS='-Wall -O0 -g' python3-debug dist/setup.py build  #<2>
PATH=$PWD/build/scripts-3.7:$PATH PYTHONPATH=$PWD/build/lib.linux-x86_64-3.7-pydebug/ rdiff-backup -v 10 \
	/some/dir1 /some/dir2
[...]
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
<1> just to be sure
<2> the CFLAGS avoids optimizations making debugging more complicated

At this stage `coredumpctl list` shows me that my coredump is the last one, so that I can
call `coredumpctl gdb`, which itself tells me (in multiple steps) that I'm missing some
more debug information, hence the above `debuginfo-install` statements (I guess you could install
the packages without version information if you're sure they fit the installed package versions).

So now back into `coredumpctl gdb`, with some commands because I'm no gdb specialist:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
help
help stack
backtrace  #<1>
bt full    #<2>
py-bt      #<3>
frame <FrameNumber>   #<4>
p <SomeVar> #<5>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
<1> get a backtrace of all function calls leading to the coredump (also `bt`)
<2> backtrace with local vars
<3> py-bt is the Python version of backtrace
<4> jump between frames as listed by bt using their `#FrameNumber`
<5> print some variable/expression in the context of the selected frame

Jumping between frames and printing the different variables, we can recognize that:

. the core dump is due to a seek on a null file pointer
. that the file pointer comes from the job pointer handed over to the function rs_job_iter
. the job pointer itself comes from the self variable handed over to _librsync_patchmaker_cycle
. reading through the https://librsync.github.io/rdiff.html[librsync documentation], it appears that the job type is opaque, i.e. I can't directly influence and it has been created via the `rs_patch_begin` function within the function `_librsync_new_patchmaker` in `rdiff_backup/_librsyncmodule.c`.

At this stage, it seems to me that the core file has given most of its secrets and I need to debug the live program:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ PYTHONTRACEMALLOC=1 PATH=$PWD/build/scripts-3.7:$PATH PYTHONPATH=$PWD/build/lib.linux-x86_64-3.7-pydebug/ gdb python3-debug
(gdb) break rdiff_backup/_librsyncmodule.c:_librsync_new_patchmaker
(gdb) run build/scripts-3.7/rdiff-backup /some/source/dir /some/target/dir
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The debugger runs until the breakpoint is reached, after which a succession of `next` and `print <SomeVar>` allows me to analyze the code step by step, and to come to the conclusion that my
quickly `cfile = fdopen(python_fd, ...` is somehow wrong as it creates a null file pointer
whereas python_fd looks like a valid file descriptor (an integer equal to 5).

=== ResourceWarning unclosed file

------------------------------------------------------------------------

	rdiff-backup -v 10 /tmp/äłtèr /var/tmp/rdiff
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tells you indeed where the file was opened: `Object allocated at (most recent call last)` but it didn't really help me get rid of the warning, hence https://github.com/ericzolf/rdiff-backup/issues/18 until further notice.

=== Debug client / server mode

In order to make sure the debug messages are properly sorted, you need to have the verbosity
level 9 set-up, mix stdout and stderr, and then use the date/time output to properly sort
the lines coming both from server and client, while making sure that lines belonging together
stay together. The result command line might look as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
rdiff-backup -v9 localhost::/sourcedir /backupdir 2>&1 | awk \
	'/^2019-09-16/ { if (line) print line; line = $0 } ! /^2019-09-16/ { line = line " ## " $0 }' \
	| sort | sed 's/ ## /\n/g'
------------------------------------------------------------------------
